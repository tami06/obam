Interessant t√©moignage. Quelques longueurs.
",France,29 novembre 2018,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  La premiere moiti√© du livre est particuli√®rement interessante car elle montre comment une petite fille noire nee dans une famille modeste am√©ricaine arrive a se hisser socialement grace a sa force de travail et son intelligence, sans jamais renier ses origines. J'ai regrette quelques longueurs et parties r√©p√©titives dans la deuxi√®me partie (la vie a la maison blanche principalement, presque un peu trop "" Paris Match"").Si l'on en croit Michelle (et elle en donne pas mal d'exemples concrets), son mari et elle avaient eu toujours comme intention de rendre la vie des gens meilleure. Ils ont une √©thique forte. Le contraste avec la pr√©sidence actuelle en est d'autant plus frappant...Livre plaisant au global.ps: ne pas s'attendre a des revelations. Quelques petits details non connus jalonnent le r√©cit, ca et la, mais rien de majeur. Le contraire eut √©t√© √©tonnant.

Obama
",France,15 octobre 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  Il y des personnages qu'on aime. Michelle Obama est de ceux-l√† par sa chaleur humaine, son √©nergie, son courage et ses valeurs. Le livre raconte son ascension sociale (et celle du couple!) √† force de travail, d'un milieu tr√®s modeste jusqu'au sommet de l'√©chelle sociale. Malgr√© la distance dans le temps, je la rapproche d'Eleanor Roosevelt. Le tableau de la vie politique est cru, on comprend qu'elle n'ait pas voulu se lancer dans la course √† la pr√©sidence!

Reading biographies is not really my thing, but this ONE I highly recommend!
",France,3 f√©vrier 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  I am not a ""biography"" reader, I am more a science fiction or fantastic reader. Then I saw Michelle's interview in Jimmy Kimmel show. And I am intrigued to know more about her.This book is awesome! How she described her feelings, thoughts, and visions is easily understood. I can imagine clearly how and what happened in the situations told.The more I progress in the book the more I admire Michelle Obama. Not because she was the first lady of US but because she is an inspiring human being with all the strength and weakness as she described in the book.

Today again I heard an 18 year old daughter of a friend express the fear that she might not be good enough...
",France,2 janvier 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  Michelle Obama‚Äôs book should be mandatory curricular reading for all young women... A lived lesson in universal female experiences speaking to all women, whatever her nationality, education level, race or religious persuasion... She speaks to and for us all... A real 21st century role model who has defied all detractors with integrity... M McG

L'un des meilleurs livres que j'ai pu lire !
",France,25 ao√ªt 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  Il s'agit ind√©niablement de l‚Äôune de mes meilleures lectures ces derni√®res ann√©es. J‚Äôaurais voulu que ce livre ne se termine jamais ! J‚Äôai absolument ador√© d√©couvrir l‚Äôhistoire de Michelle Obama, de son enfance au sein d'une famille modeste de Chicago √† son r√¥le de First Lady √† la Maison Blanche.J‚Äôai trouv√© ce livre merveilleusement bien √©crit, la douceur, la sinc√©rit√© et l‚Äôenthousiasme de Michelle Obama transpirant √† chaque page. M√™me si un partie de l‚Äôhistoire nous est √©videmment tr√®s famili√®re, Becoming m‚Äôa autant tenu en haleine qu‚Äôun bon polar. Cette biographie est un merveilleux exemple de pers√©v√©rance, d'humilit√©, d‚Äôoptimisme et de gr√¢ce. A lire absolument !

Interesting book
",France,6 janvier 2019,NaN,"

  Bought the audible version. I started it 2 weeks ago and have not yet finished my listening (now i almost finished her period as a student at Princeton).In my opinion, it is a very interesting book, Mrs Obama is a great story teller. She shared her moments in a friendly way, her style is personal, approchable and easy-reading. Like always, her moral strength, her courage and her deep reflection touched me.Her childhood and her student life made me think about my own experience. Growing-up in a modest Chinese family, I was the first of the whole family to go to college and the only among all cousins who obtained a master degree. When i studied in a famous grand √©cole in Paris, as a foreigner, i was unconfortable even afraid of the new environment, facing my new classmates who seemed more clever and whose families enjoyed much better conditions than the mine.  The questions such as where i belong to and where i am leading to haunted me during that time and even much later when i started to work in France. During the years, i was afraid of directing my thoughts on that, even the slightest made me react. Of course i never mentioned to anybody, neither my parents nor my husband. Now when Mrs. Obama unfold her experience as a black femal student in a prestigious university as Princetone, the similarity of the feeling of unease and difference gave me some release.  The mine was not isolated and there was no reason to hide.I recommend this book to every one who is curious of understanding Mrs Obama's life and who is just looking for interesting stories. There must be something which will catch your attention.For the moment i gave 4 starts, it is very possible that i upgrade the scole once i finish the book.

Read it, share it!
",France,17 novembre 2018,NaN,"

  It is empowering, moving, uplifting and motivating, especially in the troubled times we live in now, to read such a book. When she could have used this opportunity to get back at some people and settle score, Michelle Obama chose to share her story and her truth. I simply couldn't put this book down. By the time I finished the last page, I knew she would remain one of my favorite first ladies of all times.  So read this book, share it, pass it along. It is such a rare gem!

super int√©ressant et bien √©crit (je recommande la version audible lue par l'auteure)
",France,28 mai 2019,NaN,"

  Alors j'ai √©cout√© ce livre en version audio lu par Michelle Obama et c'√©tait tellement bien (c'est une excellente lectrice aussi).On d√©couvre son parcours, la place de sa famille, la vie quotidienne √† la Maison Blanche, ses valeurs et j'ai vraiment beaucoup aim√©. En audio, j'ai m√™me eu les larmes aux yeux lorsque sa voix se brisait pour √©voquer des moments difficiles.Le moins qu'on puisse dire, c'est qu'elle ne m√¢che pas ses mots et que parfois son c√©l√®bre mari en prend pour son grade car elle aborde aussi la question des femmes dans le contexte de sa position de premi√®re dame.En tout cas √ßa vaut le d√©tour et c'est vraiment quelqu'un sur qui je pourrais prendre exemple en terme de mani√®re de mener sa vie, vraiment une femme int√©ressante.(et sa biographie est bien mieux que celle de son mari, c'est dit).

Incroyable
",France,23 ao√ªt 2020,NaN,"

  J'ai d√©vor√© ce bouquin de Michelle Obama!!Non seulement, il est structur√©, bien √©crit et facile √† lire. Le langage de Michelle Obama est naturel, ni soutenu ni familier, √† l'inverse des livres de Barack Obama que j'ai trouv√© beaucoup plus difficile √† lire, me mettre dedans et comprendre.On en apprend pas mal sur ce petit bout de femme n√©e du famille pas vraiment ais√©e et qui fait son chemin pour arriver avec son mari √† la maison blanche. Elle nous livre quelques sentiments et situations cocasse ou de la vie de tous les jours au centre du pouvoir am√©ricain qui nous permettent de nous imaginer (de loin) ce que la vie peut donner l√†-bas.Une femme passionn√©e et d√©vou√©e, tant √† sa famille qu'aux causes qu'elle soutient.Je le recommande √† 100%

Admirable and hopeful
",France,6 f√©vrier 2019,NaN,"

  I‚Äôve finished reading Michelle Obama‚Äôs memoir minutes before the start of President Trump‚Äôs state of the union address.  Obama‚Äôs hopefulness in the down deep goodness of much of our nation provides a stark contrast with the ugliness that I fear will hit our ears in a few minutes.  Overall, the book inspires, though I think Michelle Obama possesses a far livelier, richer personality than comes through in these pages.  I‚Äôd say, yes, all very good, but go ahead and let your hair down a little, Michelle Obama!

Parce qu'il traite de sujets essentiels comme le d√©savantage comp√©titif des petites filles noires. Parce qu'il nous explique le prix qu'il faut payer quand on veut montre sur la plus haute marche.

The Case for the Defense - Part 1,Royaume-Uni,14 f√©vrier 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  Michelle and her husband accomplished and overcame a lot, even before they became the First Family. I think Obama's 2008 candidacy had a lot of energy and purpose. However, after he was in office, a lot of that energy dissipated and he failed to sufficiently differentiate himself from policies left down by his predecessors in many areas. What is good about Michelle's book is most of it does not focus on each and every cranny of every year in the Presidency. Most of it is her earlier life and events. The big events in the Presidency occupy very little space. I give this book one star because of the ending. Michelle clearly is very devoted and defensive of her husband and his achievements.As much as we may not like it or agree with it, political office holders normally pave the way for their successors (whether they intend to or not). Obama's choices paved the way for Trump to campaign and to win the Presidency, much like G W Bush's choices paved the way for Obama. Michelle is content to not interpret the results, but bash some of the electorate for not voting for a woman and for voting for someone she describes in insults. For a family that is normally revered for deep analysis of complicated issues, Michelle's writing style and choice of words on this was very disappointing and in my opinion, narrow-minded. Michelle comes across as believing America was best and meaningful when her husband was it's President. She has a hard time seeming to come to terms with the fact that people might make different choices or that she and her husband will have to leave behind the mantle of being responsible for the nation, in their respective areas.It was a disappointing and short handed book in my mind. Fans of the Obama's will find much to enjoy, I am sure. But those who enjoy deep analysis of history, will be disappointed. I hope that Barrack's book will be more insightful and deeper (The Case for the Defense - Part 2).

"
Tedious to read,Royaume-Uni,24 mai 2020,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  Of course, many people want to know about Michelle Obama.  However, I was disappointed by this book.  She writes so much about her ambition, she really got on my nerves with that.  All the details where and with whom she worked on what, it was really tedious, I must say.  There are many interesting bits about her private life, too.  I loved reading about her childhood.But it's not my favourite book.  When I had finished it I was glad to get rid of it and pass it on to a friend.

  A window into her life so far, Michelle Obama gives us endearing, insightful, honest memories. From growing up in a working class household in Chicago, to leaving the White House residence, her story is unique and thought provoking. If you admire and respect the Obamas, you will like this book.

Ausdrucks- und Inhaltsstark . . . . trotzdem (oder gerade deshalb) super zu lesen,Allemagne,18 novembre 2018,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  Michelle Obama authentisch wie eh und je !  Obwohl im Buch naturgem√§√ü ihre optische / mimische Pr√§senz fehlt, schafft sie es durch Ausdruck, Inhalt, Tiefe und dem ihr eigenen geh√∂rigen Schu√ü Humor und Selbstironie auf jeder Seite des Buches total pr√§sent zu sein.  Kein blablabla, kein ""ach-bin-ich-wichtig"" - pure Ehrlichkeit, Intelligenz und Reflektion ihres bisherigen Werdeganges . . . . . allerdings durchaus gepaart mit Reflektion der amerikanischen (und oft globalen) Wirklichkeit.  Das Buch hat mir nicht nur beim Lesen wissenswerte Einblicke und viel Freude bereitet, vielmehr bin ich sicher, dass es auch mein zuk√ºnftiges Leben beeinflussen wird.PS:  Schlechte ""Rezension"" f√ºr reine Auslieferungsprobleme, die absolute nichts - aber auch gar nichts - mit dem Inhalt des betreffenden Buches zu tun haben sollten von Amazon vielleicht in einer Sonderrubrik gesammelt werden.  Weder das Buch noch interessierte Rezension-Leser haben einen solchen Schwachsinn verdient.  Wenn ein Buch durchn√§sst ankommt, sollte eventuell der betreffende Briefkasten / Ablageort negativ rezensiert werden, nicht aber das Buch ! ! !

It is a book that should be read by every generation to know that anything is possible.,Inde,11 d√©cembre 2018,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  When you read a book, a good book, you get fully engrossed in the lives of the characters. It is like a short but powerful relationship that you have with them. When you pick up a memoir by Michelle Obama, there is a lot of expectation baggage at the beginning itself.I am a fan of team Obama. I have seen all possible YouTube videos of them; speeches, campaign footage, interviews, dances, karaoke performances, dinners, street interactions; I follow them on social media and a couple of years back I read Dreams From My Father by Barack Obama which was quite insightful as well. Despite these impressions already formed, this book made me admire and respect them even more.In her memoir, Michelle Obama talks about the experiences in her life that made her what she is. How she became.While political experiences are obviously a part of her narration, she does not write about politics or advocate a side. Instead, she writes about values, people, reactions, thoughts. It is really a mesmerizing story about a remarkable woman. Her not-so-privileged childhood, her struggle to balance work and motherhood and her life as the First Lady. She writes about the achievements and failures in all aspects of her life. She talks about larger issues like discrimination as well as the supposedly little things like family and love which make a difference. Surprisingly, it is relatable.The writing is eloquent, honest and simple. It feels intimate and warm. It is a story of a woman of character and strength.Some might say that good PR will ensure that this is how she is projected. I say. Read the book for the writing, the inspiration that comes from it. It is a book that should be read by every generation to know that anything is possible. That you must own your story. That you matter.

"Becoming: an uplifting, memoir grounded in reality",Canada,21 novembre 2018,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  Unlike most autobiographies, Ms. Obama opens, her heart, her fears, her worries, but mostly her hopes for her family, country and world.While most political memoirs detail behind-the-scene, make-or-break deals, this book details the impact smaller actions can have on the local level. A very useful and timely reminder for those overwhelmed by the daily scourge of bad news.

An ordinary person who found herself on an extraordinary journey‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..A book that strengthens you,Inde,3 janvier 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  For me, as for many others, the Obamas embodied kindness, decency, and -above all ‚Äì intelligence, in sharp contrast to the (cough, cough) circus that followed them in the White House.I am neither American, nor of color, nor (God forbid) will I ever be involved in any political activities. Yet, like all my friends who have read ‚ÄúBecoming‚Äù, I am completely charmed by it, and by Michelle Obama. A lot has been said about the book and its appeal. You just cannot finish this book and just forget it; her story will probably stay with you for life. I would like to add my own little inputs below (in no particular order) as to why this book was one of the most wonderful books that I read this year (or any year), and why, like millions of people around the world, I find Michelle Obama‚Äôs story so powerful and uplifting.‚ÄúYour story is what you have‚Ä¶It is something to own‚ÄùA book can be beautifully written, but I don‚Äôt really care for it if it doesn‚Äôt touch my heart. And Becoming was a very, very emotional read. Here we have a lady who has lived in the White House for eight years, and who speaks with such pride and love about her working class parents, the cramped little apartment she spent her happy childhood in, in the poorer section of Chicago, about her relatives, all blue-collared, like her parents. This is who I am, she says, this my story. ‚ÄúI had nothing or I had everything. It depends on which way you want to tell it‚Äù. We can think of many women in her position who would perhaps underplay their background, hide some of the facts, but not a strong, direct, honest woman like her. It is this humility, the pride and the self-respect with which she shares her background with the rest of the world, which will touch you to the core. ‚Äú‚Ä¶they (my friends in South Chicago), like me, were descended from slaves‚ÄùLike Michelle points out, repeatedly, let us not forget for a minute her roots ‚Äì that not too long ago, her forefathers were working as slaves in a country they were forcefully brought to, loaded like animals onto ships from Africa.  ‚ÄúI was the great-great-granddaughter of a slave named Jim Robinson, who was probably buried in an unmarked grave somewhere on a South Carolina plantation‚Äù.America might have got its first black President, but ‚Äì a century and a half after the Civil War of 1865, and more than half a century after the Civil Rights Act of 1961 -  racial discrimination is still alive and kicking in that country.‚ÄúI carried a history with me, and it wasn‚Äôt that of presidents of First Ladies‚Ä¶The struggles of Rosa Parks and Coretta Scott King were more familiar to me than that of Eleanor Roosevelt or Mamie Eisenhower‚Äù. Yes, I had to Google Rosa Parks, and Coretta King, and if the names are not familiar to you,  I suggest you do so as well, to understand what a long journey the Obamas have undertaken, and what she refers to as the ‚Äúpush and pull‚Äù of history.Her description of her Uncle Terry, who  had once been a Pullman porter, is particularly poignant, and will go straight to your heart ‚ÄúYears after retirement, Terry still lived in a state of numbed formality ‚Äì impeccably dressed, remotely servile, never asserting himself in any way‚Ä¶It was as if he‚Äôd surrendered a part of himself as a way of coping‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt know what a Pullman porter was, and I again had to Google it. What I read had me in tears. It was too late for Uncle Terry, but not for the next generation of African-Americans, and not for his brave, intelligent, hardworking niece and nephew.The power of education, or ‚ÄúI will show you ‚ÄúMichelle reached where she did through sheer hard work and intelligence, and an enormous desire to make something of herself in life. This is perhaps the only right way to ‚Äúbecome‚Äù what you want to be. ‚ÄúEducation had been the primary instrument of change in my own life, my lever upward in the world‚Äù. ‚ÄúStrive‚Äù is an important word in Ms. Obama‚Äôs dictionary ‚Äì perhaps the most important.Every schoolgirl (or boy) should be encouraged to read this book, because the lessons it impart are invaluable. It is also a book for parents to read, for the way in which Michelle and her brother were brought up by their parents is inspirational. Their parents treated them like adults, encouraged them to take their own decisions, and constantly reiterated that ‚Äì ‚Äúyou belong. You matter. I think highly of you.‚ÄùA yin-and-yang duoIn Becoming, we gain a whole new perspective of Barack Obama; not the president, but the boyfriend, husband, father and son. We meet a man who is least interested in the rat race, or in any material trappings. What excites him, and what he is passionate about are books and ideas, especially ideas to make the world a better place - ‚ÄúDo we settle for the world as it is, or do we work for the world as it should be?‚Äù. Unlike Michelle, he is ‚Äúhardwired for optimism‚Äù, and while she is a detail person, a box-checker, Barack is quite at home with ‚Äúthe unruliness of the world‚Äù. It was clear early on their relationship that ‚ÄúWe were built differently‚Äù. Yet their relationship thrived, and when Barack‚Äôs aspirations became clear, she supported him, not because she thought he would win (‚ÄúBarack was a black man in America‚Ä¶. I really didn‚Äôt think he could win‚Äù), but because she loved him. The rest is, of course, history.The end of Obama‚Äôs term, and the next occupantWhen she walks out (almost with relief, it seems) of the ‚Äúmost famous address‚Äù in the world, she begins a fresh journey ‚Äì all over again. And that, perhaps, is what awes you and touches you most about her ‚Äì that she doesn‚Äôt let her years as the FLOTUS define her, or restrict her in any way. While being a loving, supportive wife and mother, she could never be JUST Mrs. Obama, the wife of arguably the most powerful man in the world.  She was, and will always be, a person in her own right. A person who has strived all her life, and will continue to strive, to be the best she can be - constantly evolving, constantly reinventing herself.The White House was definitely not the end of the road for her ‚Äì ‚Äúyou are left in many ways to find yourself again‚Äù. As is her nature, she makes no bones about the current occupant of the White House, expressing her opinion in a direct,  upfront manner. ‚Äú..we were up against a bully, a man who among other things demeaned minorities and expressed contempt for POWs, challenging the dignity of our country with practically every utterance‚Äù.Becoming‚ÄúBecoming‚Äù is about Michelle‚Äôs childhood, her Ivy league education, her career, her abiding love for her husband and children and her country, her years at the White house, but above all, it is about a woman who steadfastly holds on to her identity in spite of being married to the most powerful man in the world. She was never a ‚Äúmissus defined by her mister‚Äù, ‚ÄúAt 54, I am still in progress, and I hope that I always will be‚Äù.It‚Äôs people like the Obamas who make America great. Not the bullies who are currently in power ‚Äì they take America back to the dark ages. That, at least is my view; your views may be different ‚Äì but hey, it‚Äôs a free world, isn‚Äôt it?Please hit the like button if you liked my review. It feels so good to know that there are people who are reading my reviews, and who believe in a better and fairer world. Thank you.

Political & Personal Journey of Hope & Love.,Royaume-Uni,29 novembre 2018,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  As a number of my fellow reviewers have already outlined in considerable detail the contents of this engaging book, I'm simply going to summarise the main strengths for me.  Primarily I thought this autobiography balanced the political and the personal aspects of Michelle's life in an honest & insightful way.  The curve of the political is inevitably mirrored in her family life, and she is very good at exploring the effects upon her daughters as well as her husband, 'warts and all'.  The voices and characters of her girls are allowed time to come through, as well as her impressive husband.The photos chosen to illustrate her book reflect a similar balance of family and political life, and many of the informal shots have a real sense of love shining out at the reader, which I found very moving. My only gripe is the four (yes, really) pages of acknowledgements she makes, where she really seems to lose her ability to be selective.  However, that's a tiny moan within a very impressive and moving testament. It does give you hope, especially in our increasingly blinkered & bigoted world.

This is an eloquently written memoir by a woman who found herself in quite a unique situation and, as she done throughout her life, handled it with intelligence, grace, and compassion. Michelle Obama is a remarkable as all the other reviewers here recognise. Well, all but one who is clearly a Trump supporter among other vile things. I can't recommend this book too highly.

  What a wonderful book and how beautifully written! I was with Michelle Obama every step of the way and found the book impossible to put down. She comes across as a caring, clever and passionate woman and her love for Barack shines through. I found ""Becoming"" inspirational and hope that her legacy, and that of her equally inspiring husband, is not squandered by the current incumbent of the White House.

Thoughtful and inspiring,Royaume-Uni,30 d√©cembre 2018,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  The book starts with how the Obama‚Äôs left the White House to quickly turn to Michelle‚Äôs Chicago-Southside youth  Princeton and her relationship with Barack. It reads well, is warm and sentimental at times. The book neatly fits into the class-struggle story category.It‚Äôs essentially all about creating our own life based on your own values rather than living up to the expectations of others. Yet the amazing thing is that she gave up a great career opportunity to support her man which in turn drove her into one of the most controversial roles; that of First Lady - that merely dresses well, shows up at public events and that diligently supports her husband. Yet as we all know, Michelle broke with most protocol in a gracious manner and gave it her own twist. And by doing so she took the top spot among female icons of this century.Other than I feared the book is not overly political, in fact she dislikes politics, albeit there are a few sneers at former president Bush.I got the hard cover of the book that although a bit bulky to carry around displays well.

  Mrs Obama is a real American success story, from Chicago's Southside to an international icon.  As an ex-pat American, living for 23 years in the U.K., the Obamas did and do represent the country I grew up in - a land of opportunity, even for those that were historically oppressed and still are.  Whatever you might think about the U.S. and its policies, this woman and her family have done us proud.  It is a good read, humorous and warm.  Worth buying for the story about how he proposed to her if nothing else but of course there is so much more.  Michelle Obama has done and will continue to do much good in the world.  I'm buying everyone a Christmas copy.

"""Failure is a feeling...long before it becomes a result.""",Canada,16 novembre 2018,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  Regardless of the varied  political views held by my Canadian family and friends, no one has ever said anything bad about Michelle Obama.  Quite an accomplishment around here. We all agree on her contributions to improving people's health and her amazing class. We have a ban in my home on political discussions due to all the hurt and anger that's been swallowed over the past two years. ALL admire Michelle Obama.This memoir truly holds pearls of wisdom for everyone.  It is raw, authentic, detailed and really held my attention.  Michelle Obama  enforces how important early mentors or role models are. Dr. Lavizzo, her high school principal said ""Failure is a feeling, long before it becomes a result"" as he struggled to uplift and defend his community. Michelle's Mom, when realtors were suggesting people sell their homes and get out of the South Shore area of Chicago quickly before it's too late,  started raising money for classroom supplies, held teacher appreciation dinners and lobbied for high performance student classrooms.  Just some of the superb role models Michelle was exposed to.This memoir covers from childhood to now and certainly includes all phases including the high end of her amazing life so far.  All the small personal details drew me in.  She shares how suffocating it was to not be able to open her windows in the white house due to security concerns.  She so wanted to let the breeze in.  Or how she just wanted to make her own toast!  Have a little privacy.  Such a personal and detailed raw memoir which included problems with her marriage and fertility.An amazing read.  I was glued to this book.  When you consider how her ancestors may have assisted in the building of the White House as slaves and she became the First Lady. Remarkable high achieving Lady. Highly Recommend.

  I thought I might like this book but good no idea how hooked I'd be.  The book was a complete we're opener for me and I respect Michelle and her husband even more now, knowing that they didn't come from privileged backgrounds.I'd known they'd gone to ivy league universities, so had incorrectly aimed that they had come from wealthy backgrounds.  There's nothing wrong with coming from wealth, but coming from a working class background myself, I do feel a connection for those who are as self made as supported people can be.I think every black girl should read this, particularly those from underprivileged backgrounds. It's just the sort of thing that could have boosted my motivation at school had I had a similar book at the time.Well done to Michelle and Barack for trying so hard to instill their decent values during the presidency.A highly recommended book.

Authentically human,Royaume-Uni,10 janvier 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  A GOOD READ I look forward to the autobiographies of people who have retired from public life about as much as I welcome the beast from the east in February. The truth can so easily be lost in a fantasy of what I achieved or lame excuses for what I missed. Worse still it is often wrapped up in a conspicuously proud attempt at humility. Watch out, a former prime minister is at the moment enjoying the fruits of his extravagant Advance before he pens his first platitude.Thankfully, first lady Obama does not fall into any of these traps. It may be because she is not a politician and indeed in many places in this book is scornful of party politics. It may be because there is no hidden agenda of scores to settle or strap lines to fulfil. Mainly it is because she is a genuine woman who can reflect on the interaction between her personal self and the circumstances which she encounters. BECOMING is therefore a cleverly apt title.The structure of the book indicates the priorities of what Michelle Obama wants to say as we do not reach the White House until three quarters of the way through. Her early life is secure in a tightknit working class family in the poorer parts of Chicago. But socially she finds herself at a disadvantage because she is a woman and because she is black. These two themes are the foundations of her motivation as she struggles through puberty and teenage and the uncertainties that brings.Against the odds she makes it to Princeton and then Harvard before embarking on a promising career as a lawyer. Then with extraordinary determination and financial sacrifice Michelle changes course to work for community based organisations in order to make a difference to the people in her neighbourhood. During this period she has begun a relationship with another sharp mind and keen conscience ‚Äì Barak Obama. The story of their courtship is both very funny and touchingly romantic. The account of their marriage, however, is rarely heart shaped and Michelle Obama does not shrink from telling us about sessions of marriage guidance counselling.As her husband‚Äôs political career blossoms, it brings with it huge questions about their priorities and it is clear that, for Michelle, the wellbeing of her two girls is paramount. How she manages their development against increasing pressures of the public glare, physical security and the demands of Barak‚Äôs job is a story in itself ‚Äì sometimes rebellious and often heart-breaking. All the time she is asking, ‚Äòwho am I and what am I achieving?‚Äô It‚Äôs a theme on a vast scale which, more parochially, partners of prominent and ambitious people have to face.The story is told with candour, dignity and charity. Mrs Obama has vitriol only for one person ‚Äì her husband‚Äôs successor as President. Yet clearly her term at the White House is not the end of the story for this fifty five year old who with her first class mind and human authenticity can continue to make a difference to the lives of many people.Michael Turnbull

An account of all the things that truly matter,Royaume-Uni,2 mars 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  Beyond how eloquent and well written this book is, what stands out for me, is her voice in ‚ÄòBecoming‚Äô. As I read through these pages, my sense of hearing came alive. I could hear her narrate as I read her words. I could hear her pauses, her tone, the sarcastically funny lines and the long silences at times.During her eight years as FLOTUS, Michelle Obama became the embodiment of what is possible for all those who are ‚Äòothers‚Äô, be it because of the colour of their skin, their educational backgrounds, their societal circumstances or any defining characteristics forcing them to be different. Her ‚ÄòBecoming‚Äô is the telling of a humble story, from beginning to present, honest and grounded. From her early days in Chicago to after the White House era, where opening windows in one‚Äôs home is executed as a privileged act, her strong roots are portrayed on the pages that defined her as a black educated woman in her early days, a lawyer, a professional, a mother and a first Lady of the United States. Her powerful experiences are transmitted to the reader in relatable words, steering away from the over dramatic, making every account a story of truth.This beautiful book hones down the importance of living by certain unshakable values. No matter what is going on, be it in the privacy of your own home, the vastness of a white house, on international podiums or bullet proofed cars, the things that matter remain the same: family, empathy in love and a quest to become better, at it all.Now I look forward to listening to it all over again in an audiobook format, to marry the sense of hearing with her true voice.

I have nothing but admiration for her determination to succeed as a black woman in a 'white' world where often racism and misogyny exist and you are judged by your colour and your sex. America was in safe hands when the Obamas were in the White House.They wanted to make things better and worked tirelessly to break down stereotypes, setting up many excellent initiatives to try to address problems of inequality, poverty and health. They cared passionately about their country and wanted to make it a better place for all.What a tremendous shock it must have been to hand over the reins of power to a small minded xenophobic misogynist, describedas a 'baby man' whose goal is to destroy, creating hatred and fear!I hope that Michelle Obama will continue her fight and campaign for the real things that matter.

  This book was bought for daughter for her birthday as she so wanted to have it.  Will admit I‚Äôve actually flipped through it then remembered it‚Äôs not mine but a gift for daughter. Know that once she‚Äôs finished reading it I will go back to it and have a proper read of it all. Life behind one important American lady and it certainly sounds like she knows just how to get what she wants but in a good way. A journey that is both interesting and also quite an eye opener at times too. Such a normal touch at times of her life and how she became who she is today.

I loved it!,Royaume-Uni,18 f√©vrier 2020,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  ‚ÄúWhen they go low, you go high.‚Äù ‚Äì Michelle Obama.I am a little bit in love with Michelle Obama. I think she is brilliant. I was really excited to read her biography but it took me a few months to pick it up. I am kind of glad of that because the hype had died down and I was able to enjoy reading it without everyone else‚Äôs thoughts buzzing around me.Becoming¬†is so deeply interesting. Michelle Obama has never stood in the shadow of Obama ‚Äì partly I think that Barack Obama wouldn‚Äôt let her but more so because she is a feisty woman who is not just the previous FLOTUS but she is Michelle freaking Obama.I genuinely loved this autobiography. Michelle is honest. She was candid about her thoughts about how she didn‚Äôt want Barack to run for president. It is lovely to watch their love story unfold. And it is one of the most inspiring reads I have read in a long time.I really wish Michelle Obama would run for President.Becoming¬†by Michelle Obama is available now.

A remarkable memoir,Royaume-Uni,10 avril 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  Wow! I am still reeling from the effects of this wonderful biography several days after finishing this epic work. I expected inspiration - I was aware of some aspects of the First Lady‚Äôs good works with young people, especially her visits to, and ongoing nurturing relationship with, the young students of the Elizabeth Garret Anderson School - but was not prepared for the mastery of language and story-telling that makes this book for me so remarkable. She retells her life story (such a rags to riches tale that could have come from the pages of a fictional romance but is oh so very true) with such insight and clarity: her loving but poor family sharing the top floor of an aunt‚Äôs house and then the ascent to the impossibly starry heights of bringing up a young family in the White House, complete with the wearisome restraints of the terribly necessary security restrictions. Her complete love of her children and the beautifully realised love for her husband, with all the sacrifices of her own career and ambitions which enable his rise to being President, is evoked in every sentence. In my opinion a book to be enjoyed at every level and for every word to be savoured.

"Wonderful, endearing, open and honest",Royaume-Uni,25 f√©vrier 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  I immensely enjoyed this book and learned more than I thought I would.  Michelle Obama opens her heart and her past wide and lets us right in.  There is a lot to see - dealing with a disabled father, a suburb dealing with ""white flight"" and then the pressure she put herself under, this would have been an interesting book even before she met her future husband, Barack Obama.The push of the Robinson parents towards education and ambition was very impressive to read about and it is inspiring to see that Michelle Obama has continued to push for that for her own children and for other children's.  The engaged she had with schools in both Washington and London was laudable and I am sure her efforts have made a huge impacts on many of the children involved.The hard work and ultimately the loneliness and isolation of White House life shine through, it really is life in the ultimate gilded cage and the scene where she and Malia took ten minutes just to get out of their own house was striking as were some of the scenes where they attempted to balance teenage normality and national security concerns.This is a a very readable book and I would recommend it highly.

Extraordinary tale by an amazing woman,Royaume-Uni,18 novembre 2018,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  Few people make it to the upper echelons of power, and, quite possibly, even fewer will tell the narrative of their finding their pace in the world in their own authentic way, as Michelle does. This book was inspiring because of its honesty and insightfulness, and because of its humanity. I think that we all feel different, in one way or another.  But gaining perspective into someone‚Äôs otherness, that also to a large extent influences how society perceives and treats them is priceless.

  An amazingly honest account of life and all that it entailed for Michelle Obama! Frank and funny, strong and driven I've really appreciated what life  was like for you growing up in Chicago. The  journey to becoming The First Lady of the United States and life as the first black family in the White House. Such passion and commitment and desire to change and improve life for so many. Such gratitude and appreciation for your journey in life and for those who walked with you.Thank you for sharing it with us Michelle. Thank you for all you both did for America.

"A life of service, and aspiration far wider than purely personal gain",Royaume-Uni,14 novembre 2020,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  This is both a deeply humbling, and deeply inspiring read.Michelle Obama is someone whose life journey has been extraordinary. She is, rightly, admired, respected and indeed loved by many. A large part of that comes from the fact that she seems to both be extraordinary and exceptional and ordinary-like-all-of-us at one and the same time. So she is even more of a role model and inspiration than someone whose talents and achievements seem exceptional because they are not those which most of us possess. She IS exceptional, - if the world were run by more people with her qualities, what a world it would be ‚Äì but what she embodies, compassion, integrity, authenticity, intelligence, both of heart and head, are qualities we all have, but, maybe, for most of us ‚Äì and, it sometimes seems, most of us in highly powerful positions ‚Äì we don‚Äôt always understand the responsibilities and obligations of that power. I could not help set Michelle (and Barack) against those political animals whose goal in achieving power is to serve self. I guess we all have the potential of following the desires of both our ‚Äòinner Michelle‚Äô or our ‚Äòinner Trump‚Äô. It seems hugely important to have aspirational role models to look to, to inspire us to become more fully the best human we can be.She is, for what its worth, a good writer/communicator. Not just what she writes about, but how she expresses

"
Very good book by an exceptional and inspirational women,Royaume-Uni,29 mai 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  Becoming is the Michelle Obama's exceptional testimony on her personal life since childhood, her relationship with Barack Obama and her experience at the White House.It shows that Michelle Obama's life was a series of personal hardships experienced as a child in a Chicago neighborhood, from her student life to Barack Obama's accession to the White House.Her testimony shows that Michelle and Barack Obama had exceptional moments at the White House, but it does not hide the difficulties of the couple's life or the personal sacrifices made before and during the presidential term. Far from the image of a perfect, idyllic couple, combining professional success and family happiness without a hitch, Michelle Obama sincerely and authentically exposes her doubts and questions.The book of the former First Lady also presents an exciting description of the political power behind the scenes. It highlights how she has been able to use her status to defend the causes that were close to her heart, such as the fight against childhood obesity. It shows the sometimes invasive role of the media, ready to scrutinize, to spy on the slightest of his words, gestures or clothing.A very good book that will satisfy the curiosity of all those who are looking for inspiration for their personal lives and are interested in the public commitments of one of the most popular First Lady in American history.

Fantastic bio but I would have preferred a bit more about her White House experience.,Royaume-Uni,14 f√©vrier 2020,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  I always wondered what is must REALLY be like to spend your first night sleeping in the WH and for Mrs Obama coming from humble beginnings to step into an amazing building.  I enjoyed the book in its entirety and so glad that I have bought many copies for friends as presents.  Its a great read but its not until Chapter 20 that you get an insight into her life in the White House.  I can't lie.  I'm greedy.  I wanted to read much more.I understand that there is only so much that you can put in an autobiography but I would be happy to read another one called 'Beyond Becoming' which tells of her in depth experience as First Lady once she is in the WH.  Chapters dealing with separate issues; the first one dedicated to the run up to the inauguration, the day itself and her thoughts on the entire day, her wardrobe & fashion during the 8 years, her living quarters, going on state visits and arranging state visits, maintaining relations with friends and family, her eating and fitness regime, mother of children in the White House, her relationships with staff in the WH, the White House garden, her own projects, even more discussions around living their living quarters.  Please do not get me wrong, she does touch on much of these things in the book but from my own personal level, I would have loved to hear more.  Nonetheless, I loved the entire book.

  As a teenager,its not my usual reading style to read books like this.If I read serious books then its either for my GCSE or its about North Korean defectors(""The girl with seven names ""by Hyonseo Lee),I normally read books like ""The Hate U Give"" by Angie Thomas or ""The fault in our stars"".However,I have got to give it to Mrs Obama-what a brilliant writer.She hasn't used her position to gain more readers,she earnt it through her amazing writing.As a person from a different ethnic backround myself,I truly admire her for standing strong in her position while Mr Obama was in office,if you get what I mean.Slightly overpriced,but worth it.What a book...

"
A true First Lady,Royaume-Uni,15 janvier 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  I enjoy reading US political biographies and this book does not disappoint.  It is so well written and edited that you feel drawn in to Michelle's story from page 1 to the end. This is a personal account of a women brought up in a family of modest means facing the obstacles of being black and female in a country dominated by white and wealthy males. You share her achievements through hard work, determination and a loving family. When the story moves in after she meets Barak then we become deeply involved in the American political scene. You learn how Michelle balances the responsibility of being a devoted parent with the desire to make a real difference to the lives of many Americans through her position as First Lady. A truly fascinating book that I recommend.

Wow!,Royaume-Uni,28 f√©vrier 2020,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  I already knew I liked Michelle Obama. I didn‚Äôt know a huge amount about her but what I‚Äôd seen, I liked. I am now officially in love with her and her family. I‚Äôve spent a lot of time in Chicago and was actually there for Barack‚Äôs Presidential win (albeit 3 miles away in bed in a hotel room but you know, I‚Äôm clinging onto that fact). Reading about her childhood there and her family was fascinating and I must admit, eye opening. I had no idea of the humble beginnings both she and her husband came from. What a story. The highlights for me where Michelle describing moments I can actually recall. Snippets and flashes of a memory of maybe a news reel at the time. Reading what was going on behind the scenes during those moments was so interesting. The facts about the White House and the secret agents.....I just loved it all. I have nothing but respect for this lovely lady and her husband. I was gutted to finish the book :-(

"Inspirational story from the bottom to the top, the real American Dream",Royaume-Uni,16 octobre 2020,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  Her early years are the most fascinating, the stories of her family home, her fathers plight with MS and her indomitable Aunt who lived downstairs are gripping and interesting.  Her school years and following her big brother in his life choices, a lovely tale of a younger sister and obviously much loved daughter.  The interesting story of her parents and her extended family and life in South Chicago are all very readable and provide an insight into her life.  Interestingly it is in the White House days and her time with Obama when the book starts to be less interesting.  Although we do learn about living in the White House, the trials and exhaustion of campaigning, that time is more subdued and more about what happened rather than the characters.  Her mother is present throughout but is not given the attention that could have been done in expanding on her personality, other than that she is obviously supportive and hard working.I don't read autobiographies or biographies and only read this because of my Book Club.  I have to say, this book didn't change my mind, I fail to believe that people won't white wash their own experience and we are only hearing one voice in a story of events, and this book didn't change my mind on that.What does come across is the the stellar path that Michelle's life has taken, even before meeting the future Mr President, and it is clear that Barack Obama is an incredibly hard worker, driven and intelligent.It is an inspirational tale of the benefits of education and supporting family environment and that everything can be possible.  I also have to admire her striving to support opportunities, particularly for women and girls and there are some interesting highlights, e.g. meeting the Queen.  The latter part of the book though was a bit too much on making excuses (I only made that slip up in the speeches because I didn't have the appropriate support / I didn't wear the right thing because no-one told me otherwise).  Own up to making mistakes, it makes everyone human so the latter part of the book felt more like a very conscious effort to do her best by her husband in the book.  What it did for the book reduces the reading pleasure by not humanising some of the events and experiences enough, a wee bit too much spin, maybe all those years in the White House really did leave their effect.  Whereas the early years were easier on the spin and more honest.  If you do like autobiographies, do read it, it is enlightening and at times entertaining and I am glad I read it, I also enjoyed the pictures.  But if you are looking for a well written book in its own right, then maybe better do what I am going to do and stick to fiction.

"
"Gut geschrieben, interessant und aufschlussreich",Allemagne,17 d√©cembre 2018,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  Das Buch ist fl√ºssig geschrieben und sch√∂n und zugleich spannend zu lesen. Vor allem Michelle Obamas Kindheit, Jugend und Studienzeit werden so intensiv und mitrei√üend geschildert, dass man das Gef√ºhl hat, mit diesem sympathischen, intelligenten, ehrgeizigen M√§dchen zur Schule gegangen zu sein oder sie noch von fr√ºher zu kennen. In ihren Erinnerungen gibt sie tiefe, pers√∂nliche Einblicke in das Leben und die Geschichte ihrer Familie, in ihren eigenen Werdegang und ihre Motivation bzw ihre Erwartungen ans Leben. Die Anf√§nge der Liebe zu Barack Obama ist s√º√ü erz√§hlt; sp√§tere Jahre finde ich zu schnell abgehandelt und man verliert ein wenig den Draht zu dieser Frau, weil der Fokus des Buches pl√∂tzlich auf dem Mann zu liegen scheint und Michelle zwischenzeitlich zu einer reinen Nebenfigur wird, w√§hrend Baracks Erfolge und Aufstieg geschildert wird.W√§hrend die ersten 30 Jahre so pers√∂nlich erz√§hlt sind, dass man meint, schon ewig mit Michelle Obama befreundet zu sein, werden sp√§ter gro√üe Ereignisse in ihrem Leben eher faktisch dargestellt. Die Schwangerschaft mit ihre zweiten Tochter zum Beispiel ist gerade einen Satz wert, die Kinder und sp√§ter die Scheidung ihres Bruders wird nur in einem Nebensatz erw√§hnt, die Erz√§hlung fokussiert sich (wie vielleicht auch das Leben der Autorin zu diesem Zeitpunkt) auf den Werdegang des Ehemannes, den politischen Aufstieg, seine Kampagnen, Reden, Entscheidungen und Siege, bei denen Michelle zun√§chst eher passiv dabei ist. Das tief Pers√∂nliche geht zwischenzeitlich verloren, als w√§re die Frau in ihrer eigenen Geschichte in den Hintergrund ger√ºckt. Wahrscheinlich war es zu manchen Zeiten auch so, was mir leid f√ºr sie tut, weil sie selbst √§u√üerst interessant, inspirierend und sympathisch wirkt. Dennoch habe ich das Buch mit gro√üem Interesse gelesen und habe mich dabei nie gelangweilt. Es hat mir so gefallen, dass ich es dieses Jahr auch zu Weihnachten verschenken werde.

A thoroughly illuminating and beautifully written memoir,Royaume-Uni,26 mars 2020,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  I looked at this book several times over many months on the book shelves generally in the top 10 bestsellers, sort of interested but never completely compelled to buy it. I am a big Barack fan but knew really little about his wife Michelle (despite her being first lady for 8 years) and it was only when on an Amazon browse for another woman's book that 'Becoming' showed up and I noticed, what is it like something like over 15,000 reviews an average 5* then I simply felt, whoa! that's awesome, its really about time I finally checked her out and boy am I so pleased I did!  It drew me in from the 3rd or 4th page and I could barely put it down after that and as another reader mentioned the writing is sublime she has such a way with words, so beautifully written and definitely one of my books of the year so far! It is so well written, with such honesty and integrity and transparency she literally bares her soul to the reader. This is 150% a book that I would recommend anyone read. A thoroughly illuminating and beautifully written memoir. Thank you Michelle.

Her legacy will live on, for many years to come. I found the book so engrossing and finished reading it over the first weekend that it arrived. This book shows why Michelle Obama was loved wherever she went, both in the USA and the rest of the World. I cannot recommend this book highly enough.

Amazing....,Royaume-Uni,1 janvier 2020,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  I listened to this book as an audiobook read by Michelle Obama.I loved every moment of the recording from start to finish. The story flowed taking me along for the ride.  By the time I got to the end of this book I felt exhausted having shared in Michelle‚Äôs amazing journey.  I never wanted it to end.This book evokes many emotions: I wept in parts of the book;  I laughed in others, and; I gasped in other areas. I fell in love with her mum and dad and Michelle‚Äôs love for them was evident.Michelle is a great story teller and shared her own personal journey in a very open, honest and compassionate way.I have learnt many life lessons to take away with me.  This is a book that I want on my shelves to read again and again as it contains many other lessons for me to learn in the future.  I have ordered a printed copy and will pick it up tomorrow.This is a must read for anyone that wants to live a fulfilling life and wants to learn from a great teacher.

An Outstanding Book by an Outstanding Woman,Royaume-Uni,2 janvier 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  Michelle Obama is an inspiration.Nobody who reads this book can fail to appreciate what an exceptional, fiercely strong and deeply caring person she is.She writes brilliantly about every aspect of her life, from her character forming childhood on Chicago's gritty South Side through to the adjustments needed when moving into the White House with two young children and a husband she deeply loves and admires.One of my favourite aspects of the book is that it also gives a unique insight into Barack, which you‚Äôre unlikely to read in any of the many books specifically about him.Michelle Obama‚Äôs dignity and kindness appears to be matched only by her strength and tenacity, rare combined qualities in anyone and probably the reason she dislikes politics so much!One of the best books ever to grace my bookshelf (and kindle). Yep, I have two copies. Seemed rude not to have both.Enjoy the ride. It‚Äôs quite the story.

It was alright. Bit bored. Good content but a bit long.,Royaume-Uni,8 septembre 2020,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  Whilst the content is good, her writing style is heavy. Why use 5 words when you can write 50? She drolls on somewhat. She is articulate and comes across full of conviction, and takes life fairly seriously. 60% of the book was pre-Whitehouse days.  She has a lot to be proud of and has achievements, but she knows it. I guess it is just typically American, and we British folk tend not to toot ones own horn. Appreciated learning about her views and experiences on race and inequality, and was impressed at her contributions at bringing change. She's an excellent role model to young women. Just struggled with how many ""I"" ""me"" and ""my"" were used. I get it... The book is about her, I just got a bit bored.

  Quite moving and challenging for me to read this as a white privileged male.The challenges Michelle Obama has had to overcome and the sacrifices she made to support her husband's election, when she was a real high flyer herself, really affected me. The book shows you that it's hard enough being in politics, hard enough being a woman, hard enough being a high achieving person when you're black, but being all of those things then effectively having to stand aside for her husband - wow, what a huge challenge. And yet she stepped into the role of first lady with real class, elegance, humour, good nature, maturity.

Her many initiatives during her tenure as First Lady were so worthwhile, I can only hope they survive the current regime! She and Barack were such a breath of fresh air in the White House it is just a shame a lot of their good work is being undone now. I will be reading this again very soon.

Es ist an manchen Stellen etwas langatmig, dies ist jedoch bei den meisten Biographien so. Es ist sehr angenehm zu lesen. Ich habe gelacht und geweint und viel gelernt.Ich war √ºberrascht, wie viele Selbstzweifel und Probleme eine nach au√üen hin so perfekte Frau hat - in etwa n√§mlich genauso viele, wie jede andere Frau (wenn auch nicht die selben). Ihre Unsicherheit trotz ihrer bemerkenswerten Karriere (Impostor Syndrome), der Kampf mit der Vereinbarkeit von Muttersein und Arbeit - und nicht zuletzt die Probleme in ihrer Ehe lassen Michelle Obama noch sympathischer und bodenst√§ndiger wirken, als es eh schon der Fall ist.Am bemerkenswertesten fand ich √ºbrigens - aus vielen Gr√ºnden - den Satz ‚ÄûI didn‚Äòt really think he could win.‚Äú.Ich war und bin nach wie vor ein gro√üer Fan dieser Frau und hoffe, in Zukunft noch viel von ihr zu h√∂ren.Das Buch lege ich allen ans Herz, die sich gern von starken Frauen inspirieren lassen (die nicht immer ganz so stark sind, wie sie scheinen, sondern ganz oft einfach nur Menschen wie du und ich sind).

An interesting insight into Michelle Obama‚Äôs  life history and the  Obama presidency,Royaume-Uni,7 juillet 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  An interesting and informative look into Michelle Obama‚Äôs life history and her path to the White House. She emphasises the importance of a stable and loving family who gave her high aspirations combined with a strong sense of commitment and morality. She was well on in her legal career and plans for a stable and successful future when she met and fell in love with Barack Obama. That relationship altered the course of her life and her perspectives on what constituted a successful future. From then on, we see, not only the way her own career and family life developed but also the developing political career of Barack Obama ending in his successful bid for the presidency. As a by product, the book gives a fascinating look into life inside the White House and the particular approach of the Obama family.

Starting, inevitably, with her childhood, then her career and meeting Obama and finally the election and what it was like to be First Lady. Each stage was enlightening and I loved reading about the dynamics of their relationship as well as the crazy security around the President (good crazy, just mind blowing).I really enjoyed and would recommend.

They lived under the for-ever regrettable shadow of ""being black"" for all this time, and were abused, and loved too.  Always loved.

Inspiring and Captivating,Royaume-Uni,9 f√©vrier 2020,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  I was gifted the audible version of this book by a coworker and then I bought the hardcover to gift to a friend. I loved the audible version because it is read by Michelle Obama and hearing her words in her voice was so much better than had I read it, which I normally would prefer to do. I do love the having a physical book though especially when it is one you‚Äôre proud to have on the shelf. I didn‚Äôt know much about her at all when I started it. It was so inspiring and impactful and I was left feeling in awe that this normal yet extraordinary woman was the First Lady.

  For average folks like us, we seldom get to experience the life of someone like Michelle Obama, yet through reading this book, one comes to gradually understand the importance and influence held by her.Indeed she doesn't just represent hope and change for minorities, women, LGBT, but also for everyone irregardless of whatever conventional categories we're forcefully labelled as by society.At the end of the day, we all return to our respective homes and families, we are all one people!

  Loved it and have recommended this book to lots of women !  It‚Äôs remarkable for being so inspiring , honest, intelligent, refreshing, moving, and deeply deeply heartwarming !  It left me feeling enormous admiration for the Obama family and made me miss them, their honesty and intelligence, all over again and weep with nostalgia for those beautiful days before the shadow of death, corruption, humiliation and misery was cast over America by the Trump administration.

"A Great Read, Difficult to Put Down",Royaume-Uni,3 septembre 2020,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  Love everything about this book. Well written, Enjoyable, Hard to put down. A real eye opener and truth about how through hard work, sacrifices, dedication and determination the Obama's were able to achieved their goals. They didn't come from money, just worked hard and maintained their focus. She certainly proud of her husband as he is of her...and we are of them.They definitely represented the USA with love, transparency and decorum, certainly a far cry from the lies and hate currently being spewed by the current  administration.Melania is well known for copying Michelle's work, imagine her writing a book with the same title...geez would she be able to add photos of her early lifestyle as an ""independent women"" in Slovenia? ...Don't think so!!!  Then there's DJT... every man and is Dog is writing about him...none of which is good!!!!

"Most Enjoyable, Informative Book",Royaume-Uni,26 f√©vrier 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  Michelle Obama has written a heartfelt book which I found very interesting and easy to read.  The descriptions of her early life on the Southside of Chicago and all that led up to her becoming First Lady, the first black woman to hold that position, and then the insights into life at The White House I found most fascinating.  She achieved so much during her tenure.  It is a thoroughly good read; I can certainly recommend it.

A very human story,Royaume-Uni,18 mars 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  I really didn't know what to expect from this book.  Biographies really aren't my thing but this was so highly praised by trusted friends I decided to give it a go.  And I was richly rewarded.  I found it a very human story told well.  At first the slightly folksy delivery troubled me but. either that style reduced as she went along or I became accustom to it.  Mrs Obama came across as very honest in discussing her feelings & when she felt she let herself down.  And it was interesting to see how family life functioned behind the doors at the White House!  Highly recommended!

"
Interesting read.,Royaume-Uni,29 janvier 2020,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  Read in January 2020I knew that Michelle was reluctant to be first lady as she comes across as an extremely private person, but I didn't know much about her life before that. She portrays as a warm person who cares deeply and isn't afraid to confess her feelings of inadequacy and fear that she was doing things wrongly. I did enjoy the book although I felt it dragged out in places.

"
Great book,Royaume-Uni,4 juillet 2020,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  I wasn't sure about this book to start with, I thought it might be dry and boring, but Michelle Obama has a real way with words.  I really enjoyed reading about her early life, and how it changed dramatically after she met Barack.  It was very interesting reading about the background to their very public life.  I would recomment to anyone interested in American politics or history.

"What an inspirational story, in 3 chapters!",Royaume-Uni,11 juin 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  I hope everyone reads this book, whether you like Michelle Obama or not. This book alone has the potential to save you a lot of money on couples' therapy if you pay attention to her words of wisdom. Michelle Obama writes in an honest way about sensitive topics and makes a lesson of each one. It's a deep and light book at the same time, which is easy to read and profound at the same time. Thank you for sharing all this magic with the world!

Amazing inspirational book!,Royaume-Uni,29 juin 2020,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  An amazing inspirational autobiography of a black woman who managed to overcome the prejudice against her race and her gender. Michelle is a true role model of ambition, resilience and yet selflessness. Michelle and Barack are what a real power couple is: two people fighting for a better world. Of course, this is not an easy fight; it‚Äôs never easy to change a system that has been based on inequalities and discriminations (and oppression) for so many centuries but WE are here to fight for equality and freedom, whatever it takes.Good job Michelle!

Loved it.,Royaume-Uni,4 mars 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  I have a bit of a woman crush on Michelle Obama, I won't lie. I was glad to get this for Christmas and have only reluctantly put it down. She writes honestly, is frank and her descriptions put you right there with her. It's a thoroughly enjoyable read seeing how her life started and then what happened when she met Barack. I found myself laughing out loud at her feistiness as a child (definitely see myself there) and felt truly empathetic when the periods of grief rocked her. Really a fantastic read.

Incredible read. Would give more than 5 stars if I could!,Royaume-Uni,16 janvier 2020,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  I'll keep this short, as others have reviewed far more eloquently.Michelle Obama's story is truly incredible and her style of recounting events captivates you in a way where you can imagine her sitting across the table from you having a chat.I liked the Obamas as a couple before, they were squeaky clean as public figures. Having read this book, I've become a fan girl of Michelle.

  I already had such admiration and respect for this incredible, clever, hard working amazing mother and beautiful lady. But after reading this book I didn't think I could respect and admire her anymore, but oh yes I do. Certain special people come into this world with such charisma, humility, empathy and the ability to make people's day a little better, Michelle Obama has that and so much more. We miss you and Barrack in the UK.

"The power behind the "" throne "".",Royaume-Uni,5 mars 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  This was a very easy read andtold you a lot about Michelle 's eary life and what made her the driven person she so obviously was. One was made aware of the difficulties they both had in being the first american president and first lady of colour in the Whitehouse and the different perspective that gave them of the job. Michelle brought the East Wing into much more prominence than previous first ladies had done and she and her two daughters made the American people warm to the presidency much more than her rather intellectual husband.

Cheerful,Royaume-Uni,25 novembre 2020,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  Bought second hand, arrived in pristine condition. A very good read. Accessible but quite guarded, there is always a positive spin on all details. Whilst the author claims to know the struggles of the marginalised communities, she describes quite a sheltered upbringing. If you believe in meritocracy then this is the read for you.

Thoughtful and insightful,Royaume-Uni,27 novembre 2020,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  I found this a fascinating insight into the Obama's, the American electoral system and how race plays a part in so many aspects of life in America. The story of how both rose from normal everyday beginnings to the Whitehouse was told in a beautifully engaging way. As someone the same age many of her worries and concerns as she was growing up resonated with me and emphasised that while outwardly people may look different, sound different, have different cultural backgrounds, at our heart we are all the same. We want the best for our families, we want them to grow up happy and healthy, we want to be accepted for who we are and we want to make a difference. I would recommend this book.

  I've often thought of Michelle Obama as an honest, intelligent.  & inspiring lady & always wondered what it must have been !one to raise her family in the Whitehouse, now I know. This book offers a candid an in-depth insight, upfront and personal reflection into the life of a powerful  woman's life and somehow brings it all  down to earth. I truly believe that the Obama's were the best thing to happen in American politics and it's a shame President Barack Obama could only stay in office for two terms. Great read & a must for anybody that has an interest in a candid point of view of American politics. Thank you Michelle I've thoroughly enjoyed your book.

Great informative and emotional read.,Royaume-Uni,1 mars 2020,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  This book is easy to read and gives a peek into what it's like to live  life and bring up a family in the Whitehouse! It also grapples with the tricky issues of race, gender and social inequality in our society. These issues see all dealt with in a very personal and intimate narrative but in the same turn have inspirational messages to pass on. I think this book would appeal more to women than men but is especially inspirational for all young people.

She attended both Princeton and Harvard.  Highly recommended

Amazing woman,Royaume-Uni,12 avril 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  Loved reading the story of Michelle Obama's life. She is a powerhouse behind a truly great President.  She speaks her truth clearly and always aware of others less fortunate.  A working class girl with strong morals.  I think she sacrificed  a normal family life to support her husband, at a time when her daughters were really rather young. Fabulous woman.  I recommend this book strongly, it's beautifully written from the heart.

It took me a chapter or two to get into but then I was hooked! It‚Äôs about Michelle‚Äôs journey and how she got to where she is now. It focuses on making a difference on issues such as racism and inequality but also covers interesting parts of her life like campaigning for Barack and her life in the White House. Great read!

You get a strong sense that you're getting someone's perspective and not a universal truth, which makes it feel like your really getting an insight into Michelle Obama and not her husband. It has a very strong message on the power of education and the power of preservance, particularly if your a woman. It's also a wonderful love story.

Enjoyed this book!!,Royaume-Uni,6 septembre 2020,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  What I found surprising was how much hard work Michelle had done, that perhaps wasn't reported on because of world events. She and Barack both faced disadvantages and struggles, and yet refreshingly she doesn't dwell on these as anything other than a way to connect with people who have experienced/are experiencing the same sort of situations.

"
Real and Relatable,Royaume-Uni,12 f√©vrier 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  I loved reading this book. Michelle came off so real and relatable, but yet inspiring. She laid it all bare with feeling lost in her career, to dealing with fertility issues, to managing work/campaign/life balance. She also gives credence to having a support system - no woman is an island, and it certainly does take a village. This is a must read.

Becoming always meets the Other,Canada,21 novembre 2018,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  Michele ' s authentic voice welcomes you in to the real, the joyful, the pain and the triumph grounded in love of others.  Her story is the story of many others who have lived their journeys on their private stages but struggled through critical reflection, with self value, guilt all wrapped in familial support and love. She takes us onto her public journey while always reminding us in some phrase that the choice is always ours - we have the power -we must constantly ask: Who am I? What are my commitments? Who am I becoming? This is a book for both women and men

"Here I Am, I Have Got A Lot To Say",√âtats-Unis,13 novembre 2018,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  This a book that is difficult to resist, the writing is sublime. Michelle Obama has a way with words, this is one of the most fascinating and informative books I have read this yearThere is a great deal to admire about Michelle Obama. A young woman brought up on the other side of the tracks in Chicago, went to Princeton and then Harvard for her law degree, and became the First Lady Of The United States. Some of her success was due to luck, but most is due to her intelligence and her hard work. As a woman and a black woman, she had to work three times as hard as a man, and she proved her worth.Michelle Obama tells us she is writing this book to inspire the next generation. She knows how important role models are, especially for young women of color in a culture that isn‚Äôt changing fast enough. She says in her book , ‚ÄòHere I am, I have got a lot to say.‚Äô Her book is divided into three sections-:‚ÄôBecoming Me,‚Äù ‚ÄúBecoming Us‚Äù, and ‚ÄúBecoming More‚Äù.  What we find in these pages is a woman opening herself and her world to us. This is a book so well written, with such honesty and integrity, I felt like I was trusted with her secrets.She starts by talking about her upbringing, her life in Chicago, a family who showed such love and at the same time showed her that using her intellect to move herself forward was the right path. Off to Princeton where she was a minority for the first time, learning to navigate in a white world. Then to Harvard to study law, and her first job, where she met her future husband, Barack Obama.Then the life of a married woman, working full time, wanting a family and finally succeeding via InVitroFertilization. Her husband was into politics and was often not home, so Michelle was the parent. Some resentment, and couples therapy helped them through their rough spots. Political life is difficult and the statements by some were hurtful, and she names names. The scrutiny and constraints were a lesson she quickly learned, and went onto become one of the most beloved First Ladies.Now, Michelle Obama, has her real life back, and she is discovering who she wants to be. Malia and Sasha are settling into their lives with plans of their own. Michelle Obama has no love for politics, and she will never seek a political office. Michelle, Barack and the girls are llooking toward to the future.Michelle Obama is telling the truth of her life, she grew up surrounded by love in a city, Chicago, she loves, onward to an education that took her far. She has everything she wanted, family, a husband she loves, and now she is looking at her next adventure.  An autobiography I urge everyone to read. This is a book of the year.

Soulful,Inde,14 d√©cembre 2018,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  Sometimes a book can outdo the thrills of a great film.  Specially when its written as good as Becoming by Michelle Obama.  Many of us live to witness the poll results.  It's a real life thriller.  Michelle gives an minute to minute account from campaigning to becoming the first black president.  In a country so prejudiced towards color,  beating every single odd and to win...it was like reliving those days in front of TV,  all over again.  The best lesson to learn was except for Barack everyone had doubts.  He was so sure of his dream.  It was in a way understanding what his voters wanted and how desperate they were for change.  And most of all his belief.  And like how?!!!  I often see posts of Americans wanting him back.  How often does that happen?  For everyone who loves politics this book is not just a autobiography.  It is beautiful journey of a dream to do good in this world.  Never was the dream to be president.  But to change in small ways for the betterment of society at large.  And the efforts put in by educating himself throughout his life.  Educating himself on policies,  reforms,  and understanding the need of the hour.  The best book I've read not just this year.  At par with A Long Walk To Freedom, Nelson Mandela.Could this family do anything wrong?  It's not luck,  it all boils down to immense research and learning and connecting to one's own belief and dream.

Becoming... Michelle Obama,Australie,1 avril 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  This was the first autobiography I‚Äôve ever read, so I don‚Äôt know how to compare it to others, but I LOVED it. Every single word, on every single page. And that from someone who tends to skim through the boring bits in many books.Living in Australia I saw the Obama‚Äôs in the news, of course, but I hadn‚Äôt followed them all that closely. I hadn‚Äôt felt a need to‚Äîafter all, they were doing a great job. They were a highly respected first family, doing America proud. I saw the important bits, the bits that Australian media felt worthy of a spot on the evening news, but not a lot more. And although I listened to Barack‚Äôs 3 hour speech at the Nelson Mandela centenary celebration, I didn‚Äôt know all that much about Michelle even at that stage.But in reading her book, I feel like I‚Äôve come to know her. I learned so much about what a wonderful human being she is ... the hard work and perseverance that got her into Princeton, the long hours she spent as a lawyer trying to prove and better herself, and then, when she‚Äôd made it to the top, her constant efforts to make the world a better place ... for her own daughters as well as everyone else‚Äôs.There was even one point, towards the end of the book, when I read about how she‚Äôd done Carpool Karaoke, and why. So of course I went to YouTube and watched it right away, and it made the whole experience so much more personal... almost like I was right there in the car with her.Anyway, I loved the book, and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to read about her life, her background, small snippets of what it was like living in the White House, and her hopes for the future. She‚Äôs an inspiring woman, and she makes me feel both proud and hopeful.

A ‚Äòfirst person‚Äô writing experience to savour,Australie,18 novembre 2018,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  I am left stunned, excited and shocked by the many revelations this book has given me. Most of all though I cherish the obvious truth of the writing and appreciated the thoughts of Michelle behind some of the momentous events of her eight years in the White House. Her writings though start with her early life and the inspirations she sought from her piers and family. Her story is an amazing example of courage and determination to loosen the shackles of her heritage, engage it and drive herself forward to become America‚Äôs First Lady. It was interesting as well to learn about her efforts during the Obama years to be a First Lady that used the position to champion causes that to this day resonate with so many. As an international reader outside of the US, I learned a great deal about the nature of politics in the US from the standpoint of someone who lived inside that bubble and was able to extricate herself and her family with dignity and positive future resolve. As a portrait photographer I could but dream of having her as a subject before my camera. I can but dream.

  Empowering!!Autobiography of Former First lady Michelle Obama will given you an insight about any other women who is equally competent  of balancing each and every aspect of her life.This book is not just her biography but it's also about her parents, Barack Obama and her daughters.Book is chronological divided into 3 parts.1. Becoming Me2. Becoming Us3. Becoming Morein which she shared everything from her childhood, her upbringing in Princeton,about  her marriage with Barack Obama, she being First lady and living in White House and the life after that.She has also shared  many difficult decisions like martial counselling, leaving her high salary job and IVF.Book is very inspiring and is written beautifully. Language of the book is very easy.I find her very intelligent,honest expressive,humble and passionate women who really wants to add some value to society and to others life.With optimistic attitude and her experiences she shaped herself into a very positive and inspiring person.She has proved that you can always win over your fears and self doubts.Her love story with Barack Obama is same as I had expected, full of love,confidence and respect.I loved it!!When are you reading this one?

Good book,Inde,23 juillet 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  I can see why it became bestseller for last year.Pros:It's nicely written.Brings out challenges in the life of former first lady.Cons:At places, the book sounded more like rant, where the lady is complaining just about everything.While her struggles were very much real, complaining that her husband wasn't doing enough (he was in the middle of presidency battle) for her family, isnt what I liked reading. Remember, Obama inherited the economy at its worst, when no one alive knew anything like that.Overall a good book.Could have been great though.

An uplifting and meaningful memoir with an important message,Canada,1 janvier 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  Michelle Obama‚Äôs memoir reminds us to look for the sameness in each other, to remain positive and act with dignity in the face of all challenges, and to find ways to uplift and inspire youth so our next generation can succeed in the face of many obstacles.  Peppered throughout the book are real life examples of why diversity is so important for a forward-thinking nation.This is an enjoyable memoir by a self-driven, brilliant mind; a self-possessed woman who managed to find ways to maintain her own identity and purpose while serving in the role of FLOTUS during her husband‚Äôs presidency.I particularly enjoyed the personal glimpses into the Obama's family life and how Michelle and Barack worked to ensure their daughters could find some semblance of normalcy while coming of age in the Whitehouse.A thoroughly enjoyable read!

"
Reviewing Becoming,Canada,20 novembre 2018,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  I gave it 5 stars because I could hear Michelle Obama's voice in every word I read. I was truly her words and her feelings that were put together to make a beautiful read. It brought out my own feelings and I wanted to fight with her even though I already knew what the outcome was to be. It is a book I will certainly keep in my library and read again.

Michelle Obama, thanks for being such a great role model while you were in the White House -- championing exercise and good food for children and speaking your mind with grace and courage. We miss you.

You would thank yourself for reading it,Inde,23 d√©cembre 2018,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  Delivery: Timely deliveryPackaging: it was average. The harbour cover and the jacket got a bit tempered. If you are someone who can compromise with scratch or a little wear out, then go for it. Otherwise buy it from store.Book: I bought to read it in 2019. Then, I got tempted to read a little bit. I decided to read only the preface and keep it aside to read in January. Before I know it, I was halfway through the book. Am still reading. The writing is so smooth, and it just flows on and on helping you picturized America in the 80s and early 90s. There are more than 200 pages still to go, but I absolutely love it already.Every woman should read it. Period.It is definitely an autobiography like no other.

"
Highly recommend to all.,Inde,27 f√©vrier 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  Becoming is a memoir of the former First Lady of United States of America. Michelle Obama pens down a powerful and inspiring journey of the first black lady to live in the White House. I hope my book review helps you know why you should definitely pick up Becoming by Michelle Obama. She talks about her humble and grounded beginnings in the South Side of Chicago. She was very well aware of the social short comings she would face due to the color of her skin and not belonging to a financially affluent background. She, therefore, worked very hard from the very first day of her school. Her unbeatable ambition, dedication and competitive spirit took her to many privileged places.Even though she was in so many situations where she could have been easily dominated and silenced, her level headedness and ability to take a stand for herself truly sets her apart. But most importantly, after getting best of education from Ivy league, a well paid job and a promise of comfortable future, she knew what was much more valuable. Inspired by her visionary husband, she wanted to make a change in the world. She wanted to make an impact by using the privileges that her position bought. Her support for various charities working for military families, education of females and healthier food for children have created ripples of change which will be felt for coming years.Her ability to stay grounded and know what truly matters touched one too many hearts and her passion and zeal for life inspired many.The most powerful and impressionable part of the book for me personally was to see what an amazing, powerful, fearless, confident yet humble woman Michelle Obama is. She is not afraid to take a stand for herself, her dignity and her values and she fiercely protects her family. In the world where women are taught to speak softly and align their career goals according to that of their potential marriage and husbands, Michelle Obama sets unique example of how to create your own identity and individuality while also being a supportive spouse. Highly recommend to all.

"Honest Caring, Healthy Thinking in this Frank, Insightful Book",Canada,30 d√©cembre 2018,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  Michelle Obama is REAL! Frank, honest, and a beautiful writer, she talks, acts and thinks with great caring. We're reading her book aloud to each other, enjoying stopping and remarking to each other how insightful and refreshing she is. How VERY REAL. Her book is a great education for everyone -- from what it's like to grow up in the poorer parts of southern Chicago, to experience racism but learn how to grow with it as her incredibly wise intellect took her to high school in northern Chicago and over to Princeton University for her law degree. Then to work incredibly hard, to share  and still keep meaningful ideals in mind, always with sensitivity for others who are disadvantaged, to learn how to live in the White House, meet and enjoy Queen Elizabeth, while still caring for her own children above all, encouraging their friends to come and join her as they all got their hands into the White House soil -- and learned how to grow healthy vegetables. LOTS MORE...

I ended up finishing it quickly and loving it. Obama's voice is clear, concise, and easy to read. She is thoughtful and precise. She does not waste words; her prose is not flowery, but she communicates the way she felt and thought about situations and parts of her life in a way that made me understand her perspective. A fantastic story of a high-performing, well-loved, intelligent Black girl's progress from the small apartment on Chicago's South Side where she grew up to the White House where she spent 8 years fiercely guarding her children from the rabid and cruel world media while trying to make a real difference in the country.

I even cried a bit..No one better than her to take us through their story. I love each word of the book..P.s- i bought it coz of the hype but it was worth it.

Everyone should read this book!,Allemagne,23 f√©vrier 2020,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  ""I‚Äôd been lucky to have parents, teachers, and mentors who‚Äôd fed me with a consistent, simple message: You matter. As an adult, I wanted to pass those words to a new generation. It was the message I gave my own daughters, who were fortunate to have it reinforced daily by their school and their privileged circumstances, and I was determined to express some version of it to every young person I encountered.""This book is not political. This book is Michelle Obama‚Äôs autobiography, where she goes into great detail on how she got to where she is today. She starts with her upbringing, growing up on the South side of Chicago, where her parents, her brother and her shared a small apartment on the second story of her aunt‚Äôs house. She explains how her parents were always the ones to encourage her and her brother. There is a lot of information about growing up black in the US, being an ancestor of slaves. She then explains how she got into college, ended up studying law, and how she was never happy being in corporate law. She tells us how she met Barack, how their love story developed, how they got married and had two kids, and ultimately, how Barack got into politics. Well, we know the rest.It is hard to write about this book, because I feel that no words of mine could do it justice. I could not put this book down, although it was not an easy read. I absolutely loved it. Michelle writes so eloquently and beautifully. There were so many passages I marked to go back to at a later date. Her writing just confirmed what I had already thought of her, but it was more than that: I found her life and her thoughts on it deeply interesting. It is beautiful to see how appreciative she is of her parents and other people involved in her upbringing, and how she works tirelessly to get some version of that to more of Americas daughters. There are so many things I was able to take away from reading, and I plan on rereading it sometime in the future. A powerful memoir that everyone should read!""I‚Äôm an ordinary person who found herself on an extraordinary journey. In sharing my story, I hope to help create space for other stories and other voices, to widen the pathway for who belongs and why‚Ä¶It‚Äôs not about being perfect. It‚Äôs not about where you get yourself in the end. There‚Äôs power in allowing yourself to be known and heard, in owning your unique story, in using your authentic voice. And there‚Äôs grace in being willing to know and hear others. This, for me, is how we become.""

"Sehr interessant und authentisch geschrieben, passt!",Allemagne,24 mars 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  Die Autobiografie von Michelle Obama - was soll man dazu noch sagen?Obama gibt viele, bisher unbekannte Einsichten in ihre Entwicklung zu der Frau, die wir heute kennen. Auch wenn der Blickwinkel nat√ºrlich subjektiv bleibt, erkennt der Leser aber, dass Obama sich sehr um Reflektion ihres damaligen Selbst bem√ºht und nicht eine perfekte Kindheit und eine fehlerlose Person schildert. Ganz im Gegenteil: Obama macht deutlich, dass sie ein sehr auf Erfolg gepr√§gtes und nicht immer sympathisches und liebenswertes Kind gewesen ist. Dass es sie auch viel Zeit gekostet hat, einige Irrwege zu √ºberwinden und durch Umwege zu einer erwachsenen Frau mit Tiefgang und nachahmensw√ºrdigen Werten zu werden.Sie l√§sst auch durchblicken - ohne dabei zu sehr in die Einzelheiten zu gehen -, dass der Haussegen im Haus Obama durchaus dann und wann schief hing bzw. auch jetzt immer mal zurechtzur√ºcken sein mag und dass es auch nicht immer einfach gewesen ist, mit einer so charismatischen Pers√∂nlickeit wie Barrack Obama zu leben und mit so einem eigenwilligen Charakter eine gemeinsame Basis zu finden.Diese Mischung macht das Buch sehr lesenswert und auch authentisch. Eben genauso, wie man Michelle Obama aus ihrer Zeit im Wei√üen Haus √∂ffentlich erlebt hat und wie sie sich auch vor den Kameras verhalten hat.Michelle Obama verschweigt nicht die Schwierigkeiten einer Familie, sich an ein Leben in der √ñffentlichkeit und umgeben von Security zu gew√∂hnen und sich nach M√∂glichkeit kleine Fluchten und Freiheiten zu erhalten. Wie der Kauf einer einfachen Hundeleine zu einem regelrechten Event werden kann - eigentlich ein allt√§gliches Ereignis, aber nicht f√ºr die First Family!Beim ersten Herunterladen des Buchs auf den Kindle gab es Schwierigkeiten; die Fotos, die zum Buch geh√∂ren, konnten nicht abgerufen werden. Das L√∂schen und neuerliche Herunterladen auf das Leseger√§t behob den Fehler, und das Buch lie√ü sich einwandfrei und vollst√§ndig lesen.

Insightful and readable,Australie,17 juin 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  Well written, genuine and insightful. An insight into the American pyche and hopes. Interesting to note, what from the outside seems the usual American self absorption, imagining the US President to be leader of the free world, by this otherwise insightful woman. I wonder if she feels Trump is the leader of the free world? Forgivable given her devotion to her husband though.Also noted, the usual American sense of outrage at the gun deaths in the US but the apparent inability to note how aberrant this is relative to other so-called developed countries, and to use this in argument. US public figures shy from comparing their country unfavorably to others, even when logical.Good luck to good people like her and her husband who hold hope for change in what seems from the outside to be a irredemiably failed social experiment.

  I don't think this book will ever be 'over' for me because I can see myself revisiting paragraphs and chapters and moments years later when life feels worthless. I did not read this book in order because if I did, I would have lost interest. Memoirs are not my thing. They just don't work for me, so I read this book in bits and pieces, moving around from one chapter to another, reading whatever caught my attention.‚ú® ""Now I think it‚Äôs one of the most useless questions an adult can ask a child‚ÄîWhat do you want to be when you grow up? As if growing up is finite. As if at some point you become something and that‚Äôs the end."" - Michelle Obama..üìñMichelle Obama's memoir - 'Becoming' was an instant bestseller. And honestly, I am not surprised. Michelle Obama has been a source of motivation for millions of people, especially women all around the world. Her speeches and her engagement with an audience has always been something to look forward to, her conversations, engaging and inspiring..‚ú®'Becoming' is about all those moments that made Michelle Obama the person she is today. A wife, a mother, a sister and the former first lady. The book takes us through moments of grief, self-doubt, accomplishments criticism, love. Her life has been all of this and more. And here, through this book, the message I get is loud and clear - be strong, be yourself. Its okay to be vulnerable. The world will try to drag you down (firstly lady or not), but if you believe in something, hang on to that..‚ú®The book had its dramatic moments and comic relief, certain grim realities in the life of a black woman trying to find a place in the world, the struggles of being engaged and later married to an ambitious man and the perils of raising children under the intense gaze of the world..A book I would absolutely recommend. Beautiful, profound and inspiring.

  As a senior Canadian, I have tried over the years to somewhat understand some of the politics involved with our southern neighbours, which are so unlike those here in Canada.  I do not profess to fully understand, but after reading ""Becoming"", I would like to thank Michelle Obama for giving me a glimpse into her life prior to and after becoming First Lady and wife of one of America's adored Presidents.  It was impossible for me to put the book down until The End, and at no time did I ever want to skip over any part!!  Thank You Barack and Michelle Obama for all the hard work and devotion you have given to the Office and the people of your Nation, and for helping an elderly Canadian to understand some of the rigors of being a political family in America.

She is a well educated, intelligent woman who faces racism, throughout her life, as she becomes a woman, a mother and a First Lady.  She lets us have a peek at what Barack is like behind the scenes too.  A fantastic read.  Hopefully, she will write another book soon.  I look forward to that.

An Introspective Look At Her Life,Canada,20 janvier 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  Becoming Me, Becoming Us, Becoming More, are the three platforms on which Ms. Obama structures the stories of her growth from a child born and raised on Chicago's South Side, to her time as First Lady of The United States (and slightly beyond).  I found it a thoroughly interesting read and gained some great insight into this marvellous lady.  In the Epilogue she describes herself as ""an ordinary person who found herself on an extraordinary journey"" and indeed it was.I would also say that the following - wisdom she offered us all - perhaps best typifies her spirit and character:  ""Let's invite one another in.  Maybe we can begin to fear less, to make fewer wrong assumptions, to let go of the biases and stereotypes that unnecessarily divide us.  Maybe we can better embrace the ways we are the same.  It's not about being perfect.  It's not about where you get yourself in the end .... There's grace in being willing to know and hear others.  This, for me, is how we become.""As a Canadian I have no political ""ax"" to grind vis-a-vis Democrat or Republican and thus my remarks are not flavoured by a particular bent.  I simply found this to be well-written account of of this woman's life and times, and on that basis am more than happy to say ""Recommended."".

This book touched my heart but also gave me inspiration and motivation to be strong, be yourself..üçÅIn this book, Michelle Obama talks about the experiences in her life that made her what she is. How she became. This autobiography balanced the political and the personal aspects of her life in an honest & insightful way. Its divided in to three parts..‚≠êBecoming me - In this part she has written about her childhood. Her relationship with her family,what are the issue she has to face being African American girl, her upbringing in Princeton , her struggles because of a not so good financial background and about her friends..‚≠êBecoming us - Its beautifully written about her Job being a lawyer ,how she met Obama , how her friendship gradually tuned in to love. Her struggles to become a mother, martial counselling and Obama's decision to join politics..‚≠ê Becoming more - Its about Campaigns , handling work with two daughters , giving speeches and supporting Obama, being first lady and living in white house..üåæI love the fact that inspite of being so powerful,she is such a humble and grounded personality. She sets  perfect example of being yourself and creating your own indentity.she writes about her values, people's negative reactions to her achievements and failures in certain aspects of her life.She expresses some of her experiences in a very honest manner which we might not have imagined; like problems due to racism affecting men and women, importance of education and discrimination.She has written about each and every detail from campaigning to becoming the first lady president. The way she has balanced personal and professional life is remarkable. Reaching home before kids bed time, feeding them healthy food plus imparting them important values and teaching them to behave grounded despite of being President's kids is very inspiration. Her work for military families, education of females and healthier food for children will be helpful in present and also it will  be beneficial in future also..üåºOverall a fantastic read, please do read.

And trust your instincts ... good relationships feel good. They feel right. They don't hurt. They're not painful. That's not just with somebody you want to marry, but it's with the friends that you choose. It's with the people you surround yourselves with.‚Äù‚ÄúDo we settle for the world as it is, or do we work for the world as it should be?""‚ÄúFor every door that‚Äôs been opened to me, I‚Äôve tried to open my door to others.

I honestly didn't have much interest in the book at all, I picked it up because i had nothing else to read. I'm not even half way through and had to come update my review. This book is inspiring. You don't feel like she's a former First Lady. I actually often ""forget"" that I'm reading about Michelle Obama. Her down to earth personality just has you feel that you're reading about the life, obstacles, achievements of a black woman in a white male dominated area. How she finds her voice, her path, her love.Stories about her family, the south, her experiences, how it all feels/felt. It's intriguing, informative, and inspiring. She has me thinking about what I can do in my community to help others.Definitely worth a read.

Unusual journey of a middle class woman to first lady of US,Inde,6 juin 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  It is an inspiring journey of a middle class person to first lady of US. One of  the finest autobiographies I have read in recent days. What an inspiring and moving memoir?  This book starts with Michelle's childhood and ends after she left the white house. In general, while we are reading autobiographies, we love the person whose story is narrated, but in this book we will like the spouse with equal admiration. Barack's thoughts, insights into social issues from childhood, idea of generating money, value given to family everything is extra ordinary. He has rarest qualities.Coming to Michelle, she started inspiring us from her childhood Piano classes, kinder garden to leaving high paid job for solely to get job satisfaction. The way she enjoyed and involved in every role is appreciable. As I am the one who struggled between work and life always, persons stories like this inspires a lot, as she balances not only family, self, work, but her husband political campaigns as well. Problems faced by celebrities, how every word spoken by them is analyzed, criticizing their choice of costumes are real in almost every part of world and it shows how  judgemental we are.This book also gives me political insight , how much struggle ,how much time and money were spent in election campaigns. And also, shows us how their privacy is struggled while they are in white house. She put her own mark as first lady as well, for her efforts for health and nutrition in kids.Last but not least, it became good night story to my kid as well, as he started asking me who she is , what she is while I was reading this book.

No solo porque todas las opiniones que habia leido eran buenas, pero porque Michelle Obama ha sido una persona a la que he admirado mucho desde la primera vez que la vi haciendo campa√±a para su marido.¬†Tenia miedo de que este libro me defraudara, y de que no cumpliese mis expectativas. Pero las cumplio, y las sobrepaso. Me gusto muchisimo la forma de escribir que tiene. Ha sido una lectura bastante familiar y con mucho estilo, pero al mismo tiempo bastante directo.¬†El libro esta dividido en tres partes: su pasado, su presente, y su futuro. De las tres, la que mas me ha gustado ha sido su pasado. Me gusto mucho saber sobre su crianza, y de como llego a ser la mujer en la que se ha convertido. Me encanto leer sobre sus constantes luchas contra una sociedad racista y machista, siendo una mujer negra aspirando a hacerse un hueco en el mundo de la abogacia.¬†¬†No sabia mucho de la historia de Michelle, pero si antes le admiraba, ahora es una de mis referentes. Es una mujer fuerte en toda regla, pero al mismo tiempo sabe de donde viene, y eso le mantiene con los pies en la tierra. Necesitamos a mas gente como ella en este mundo.¬†Si que hubo momentos que hablaba demasiado de la politica, pero vamos, tampoco es que me esperase menos, ha sido la primera dama de EEUU.

She says EDUCATION is everything and I agree with her 100%.I am going to make my English students read this book out loud and comment. Se is truly remarkable and I wish Michelle the best of luck!

She could be anyone‚Äôs neighbour, one of the school parents, or book club friend!  Hers is a life of persistent hard work combined with the happy luck of being born into a hard-working, loving family, and a healthy dose of fortitude that resulted in an extraordinary and inspiring path.  While I appreciate the courage it takes to reveal oneself honestly in a biography, I felt the lack of her discussion about her faith and in the role it plays in her character and decisions left me wondering if she has fallen for the common adage that religion is not an appropriate topic for discussion in polite society?

  I am glued to every word of this topnotch memoir. Michelle is a gifed writer and doesn't shy away from the truth.Her attention to the details of her childhood make this book a great read. Her life has not been a picture-perfect fairy tale- quite a bit of sadness including her dad's MS and good friend Suzanne's cancer. But Michelle, with her solid family upbringing, has become a role model for us all. Her experiences are not all sad and serious-she has a silly side, as does her husband, and I am enjoying it immensely. She brings as much to the Obama family as Barack--and her journey, as well as their journey, makes this book a classic.

"Good, surprisingly relatable",Inde,19 mai 2020,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  I enjoyed this and found it surprisingly relatable - Michelle Obama's account of her working class African American childhood is similar in many ways to an Indian middle class childhood, with the parents' focus on education and hard work as a means to get ahead in life. As far as political biographies go, this feels more honest and personal than others I've read. She talks about dealing with racism, marital struggles, feeling unfulfilled in her career as a corporate lawyer and worrying about feeling overshadowed by a more prominent spouse, things which a lot of urban Indian women might find relatable. The book is less detailed in the chapters on the White House years and anyone looking for insight on policy etc during those years might be disappointed. However, I found it quite enjoyable on the whole.

  The book came on time and brand new condition.This books is an autobiography of Michelle Obama, the former First Lady of United States Of America.The book gives glimpses of her life from her childhood days - on how she grew up , the values she was taught and the choices she made, to meeting Barack Obama and their relationship to having children , to the challenges she faced during Obama's political career to being the First African American First lady and the responsibilities and duties that she had to work towards.She expresses and shares some of her experiences in a very openly and honest manner which we might not imagine given the positions she's held - she talks often about problems due to racism affecting men and women , importance of education  and need to have nutritious food.In the early part of book , she explains how important it is to have proper education and get a job which makes you happy and how juggling between work and family can be exhausting at times , but never to give up and strive forward.Through the books she's given a new perspective towards viewing the oval office through the First Lady's perspective (I'm sure there might be other books by other first ladies) and the sacrifices one has to make and the challenges , the choices one has to take/make to keep the family together while holding the office. How it's extremely necessary to maintain professional and personal life. Also how First ladies can be more than just being an ornament in the Oval Office.It's a very inspiring story and very encouraging to young women especially if you need motivation.A snippet "" let's invite one another in.

Hope that‚Äôs what Michelle Obama gives us through Becoming,Inde,18 octobre 2020,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  In 2016, when the Obamas left the white house the gravity of what had transpired on 4th November 2016 became a reality, people were still in shock and there was fear of an unpredictable doom for both the United States as well as the world.But this story is not about Barack Hussein Obama, the uber-cool President of the United States of America, this books is about Michelle Robinson who later on we got to know as Mrs Obama, the free-spirited first lady who did more, a lot more than being just a smiling partner to POTUS.Becoming is a memoir penned by Michelle Obama traversing her life through various experiences, dreams and people by splitting it into Three parts (Becoming Me, Becoming US & Becoming More) with each exploring the different stages of her life.In Becoming Me we get to know a lot about the person ‚ÄúMichelle Robinson‚Äù, how this kid with the support of her parents didn‚Äôt just dream but found her way to the job she desired while shuttling to college in a crowded public bus.Becoming Us brings in Barack with a grin who changes her perspective of the world, guiding her from her dream job to doing something more fundamental to improve the lives of many African Americans and as Barack Obama gets more involved in politics she has to make some challenging decisions for herself & her children.And the last Becoming More takes us to White House, where she had a title FLOTUS (First Lady of the United States) though with restrained powers. She started the fight against childhood obesity not by irking the multinational fast-food giants and food manufacturing companies, instead, she promoted the idea of consuming healthy, locally grown food by growing a garden right inside the White House.Right now we need leaders who listen & stand by us during this pandemic, if we can‚Äôt have that then at least we need books like this where we see their normal lives separated from celebrity auras, their struggles & celebrations. Hope that‚Äôs what Michelle Obama gives us through Becoming and that‚Äôs more than enough reason to

Great memoir from an outstanding First Lady,Australie,30 d√©cembre 2018,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  As a keen follower of US politics, I have always held Michelle Obama in the highest regard. An inspired, earnest and approachable person, she is arguably the brightest as well as the most charismatic and influential amongst her peer First Ladies. I was very eager to dive into her memoir so I set undivided time to read it through over a couple of days. Whilst reading the first two parts I thought the story would lend itself beautifully to a film script, the third part - the part that revolves around her tenure as First Lady - felt just like a more impersonal account that read like a chronicle and left me wanting more. This latter section felt at times superficial and did not deliver the same emotional impact as the preceding parts did. I guess that this gear shift may have been a conscious editorial choice driven by the current political context, as she appeared to have tried to keep it as neutral as possible. Besides a few heart-warming anecdotes and a number of tragedies such as the shoot out at Sandy Hook (whose accounts by the point of view of the personal impact felt cut short), there wasn‚Äôt much insight of what thoughts kept evolving in the years of the presidency and becoming who she is today. Instead, the choice was to have a legacy-laden detailed account of the remarkable accomplishments of all the policies that both President Obama and she championed replacing what could have been some more private reflections to follow on those laid out in the first two parts of the book. I could not give it 4 1/2 stars due to Amazon‚Äôs rating system but despite my thoughts on the third part, I do recommend this book highly.

Wow!,Canada,27 novembre 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  As I read Becoming, I was startled with the many shared traits between Barack and my husband, John. It was interesting to read about how Barack's traits define him - his messy habits, his ""I'm on my way home"" meaning, he should be home in a few hours, and his laid back, relaxed style. I loved reading how Michelle had a hard time adapting to these traits, herself being an ambitious, woman, working straight toward her well-established goal. Never falling off her path.It's comforting to see so much of my relationship in these people, whom I admire so much - for everything they are, have done, and will do. & to read that it's okay to struggle with our differences, and eventually you come to terms with it. How miscarrying your first pregnancy doesn't mean failure, but will only strengthen you.I especially loved this passage, when Michelle talks about how she met Barack, who was ""surfacing from obscurity with a weird name and odd backstory"". It reminded me, once again, of my husband üòÖ yeees, John William Elms III, who is a confusing dark shade of beige that led people to wonder about his ethnic background. Which enabled him to make people believe he was actually a Morrocan prince, back in his high school days üòÇ #goalsThis book is just.. wow. I never expected this. And Barack reading Harry Potter out loud to his daughters. I mean. My life is complete. üòÖ And also.. I loved how this book is about Michelle's many accomplishments, and she mentions some of Barack's. But this is her story. She isn't the strong woman behind the president. Oh no. She's right there, standing beside him. And their lives are not unattainable. After all, Michelle and Barack Obama are just two regular people, like you and me. Like she wrote : ""I'm an ordinary person who found herself on an extraordinary journey.""

"Strong, earthy",Inde,24 septembre 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  I did take a long time to read the 463 pages of Michelle Obama's powerful, candid book: Becoming. I loved her story: she balanced her life, stood by her convictions, yet gave unstinting support to her husband once she was committed to him running for president. She makes a wonderful mother, an amazing daughter, sister and wife, I'm sure. Rational. logical, smart and efficient.However, after a really strong beginning and middle, to me, the end seemed a bit abrupt.

  This work has not been seriously reviewed as far as I know . The first half of the book is definitely autobiographical and a very interesting read . But ,like all those who are married to politicians and in this case to a president it inevitably becomes a recitation of political matters mainly involving Barack Obama's elections to the presidency . Considering that Michelle is a very intelligent woman some of this book is cringe making and trite to say the least . I skipped through the last parts of the book . Regrettably , because I like the Obama's ,I cannot recommend this book .

Gave an excellent insight into what it's like living in the White House and being the first family.  Though I have longstanding and close African-American friends and felt I had good insight into their lives, she made me understand more deeply, what one experiences being the ONLY person of colour in various situations.

A book to change the world,Australie,27 janvier 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  As an Australian reading this inspiring book, I can only be astonished at a country that can produce a person of such character and integrity as Michelle Obama yet also the infantile petty narcissist current US President whom the world can only look on with repugnance and disbelief.  This book is a mesmerising intimate look at two people who despite the challenges of their race and unprivileged backgrounds , together did so much for their country.  Instead of the hate some Americans felt for them, they should be proud that their country offered the opportunity for M and B Obama to become their President and First Lady.  It was a huge historical moment that the descendant of a slave, as MB is, could be First Lady.  And what a FL she was, working so hard to fulfil her projects of inclusion and aspiration among the many disadvantaged. America would be a lot better place if they had compulsory voting as we do in Australia. It keeps the extremists at bay and makes for a more equitable society. This book is brilliantly written and I can see why it is a world wide best seller.  I can only hope that Americans aim as high as the Obamas next time they do their duty and vote.  Please remember- who you choose as President affects all of us

A love story of the Obamas for each other and for our country.,√âtats-Unis,15 novembre 2018,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  The near rags to riches story of Michelle Obama is a gripping one worth reading. I didn't want to put it down. The Obamas spent 8 years in the White House without scandal or outrage. We may never see that again!She is an admirable woman and a fine role model. From a child living in government housing projects on the poor South Side of Chicago to Princeton to living in the White House, she proved herself to be a woman true to herself. Now she is one of the elites, but the book shows she doesn't forget her early days and she is filled with compassion and caring for others less fortunate. The book gives the feeling that if you knew her you would be friends because she is real and down to earth.The book succeeds in showing women they must find their voice and speak up and believe in themselves. I applaud her and the book. It brought tears to my eyes and deep appreciation for the Obamas. The book is not self-serving. It is honest and straight forward. Her brief comments on white racism also gave me a new understanding of what blacks have endured. Racism is shameful and I am now more aware of it.In the book Michelle asks the question women and girls ask themselves, ""Am I good enough,"" and she says the correct answer is ""Yes I am.""In the book she also say as she left her husband alone working at night in the Treaty Room into morning hours, she wondered sometimes if his more than 300 constituents knew how lucky they were (he was president).  I can answer that. ""Yes we did!""And to this day millions of us weep because he is no longer president and now no one is working in the Treaty Room to protect us.

A beautiful journey that compels you to rediscover yourself.,Inde,23 juin 2020,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  Am I good enough? Yes, I am.Are we good enough? Yes, we are.The journey of an average middle-class young girl from the South Side of Chicago to becoming the First Lady of the United States of America (FLOTUS), Michelle Obama has outlined her story in the most intricate way possible.When we flip through the pages of a book, some stories will inspire you, bring out the best in you, make you feel a part of their journey and, above all, give you hope to live the best version of YOU.‚ÄòBecoming‚Äô chronicles the experiences that have shaped her. The readers are welcome into her world with unnerving honesty and animated wit.Michelle - the girlWhat happens when a young South Side Chicago girl battles the odds of being the one of ‚Äòcolor‚Äô and pushes ahead? The outcome is one of that will lead the reader to be in awe of Michelle Robinson, who later becameMichelle Obama.Right from a young age, Michelle was taught a sense of self-confidence and belief in making her own decisions. This ultimately became the crux of her journey ahead.Michelle - the ambitious girlFrom working in the top firms of Chicago to charting her course through a series of non-profits, Michelle saw the world from a different perspective, her perspective. But she never let her ‚Äòcolor‚Äô of skin define who she was.Her ways to manage her demanding work schedule coupled with being present for her daughters at all times, she has beautifully showcased the struggles that almost all working women go through.Michelle - the FLOTUSAs the First Lady of the United States, Michelle Obama created the most comprehensive and welcoming White House in the history of its presidencies. While establishing herself as a powerful advocate of woman‚Äôs rights and the girls in the U.S., and around the globe, she dramatically changed the way families lead their lives, making them healthier and more active.Standing with her husband, Barack Obama, as he led the U.S. through the most harrowing moments, she has shown us that there is a silver lining behind every cloud.Their journey together comes as the assimilation of ideas, passion, the grit to do the right thing and just being focused on whatever you believe. From dealing with the nuances of having a public life to politics to being a highly ambitious career-oriented woman to raising two amazing daughters and all the work that goes on, there is something for everyone to take back from this book.‚ÄòBecoming‚Äô touches you and helps you to reason your aspirations, drives you to achieve what you thought was impossible and helps you get a perspective of the immense opportunities that lie ahead.My key takeaways-‚Ä¢ Every journey has its difficulties. It is up to you to make the best of the situation in front of you.‚Ä¢ You can be anything you want to be, only if you have the grit to achieve it.‚Ä¢ No journey is complete without the support of your friends, family and close associates. These are the people who get you going even in the toughest times.This memoir showcases all these emotions and much more.Warm, wise and visionary, Becoming is a passionate account of a woman of depth and substance; one who has defied all expectations and deftly risen beyond those expectations.A story that inspires us to do the same.

I loved her common sense approach and her deep love of family.  Obviously a very bright woman, she was a true assest to her husband and to the country.  I would definitely recommend this book.

Much to my surprise, I was enthralled by Michelle Obama‚Äôs recounting her very humble beginnings in a poor family in Southside Chicago to her rise, with much determination, to attendance at Princeton and Harvard, and then to a career at a law firm in Chicago.  Her decision to leave a ‚Äúgood job‚Äù at a large law firm to pursue a career in various forms of public service says a lot about her character.

  Disappointed with the condition of this book. I was looking forward to reading this for quite a while now and wanted the paper (not digital, or audio) version and in english.The book arrived and at first glance it looks ordinary, nice hardcover and all.. HOWEVER, when I opened it and started looking through the pages I was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED, the quality of the book is pretty POOR.The first and last pages (blue) are poorly printed with white gaps and what looks like ""paper folds"" on the ink.Browsing through the interior, the book looks more like a PHOTOCOPY rather than a printed edition. Many of its pages have ink smudges, and some others are even crooked.. meaning: uneven margins, the edges do not match one another and the text is inclined and off center. Also the binding looks poorly done.Even on the first page it has a text that reads: ""This edition is specially printed for sale in India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan and Maldives. Selling this edition outside these territories may constitute an infringement of copyright. Please return this copy if you bought it outside these listed territories."" -- needless to say I bought it outside these countries and I'm not happy with it.THIS BOOK IS NOT APPEALING TO READ, I would like to send it back free of charge and get a proper new one sent.

  ""If you don't get out there and define yourself, you will be quickly and inaccurately defined by others.""This is just one of the quotes from the book ' Becoming by Michelle Obama '. I just wish this phenomenal book would never end cause every moment of Michelle's life is worth something to learn about.She has walked us through her entire journey from being a little girl from the south side of Chicago till her last day in the White House.She met Barack in her office whom she had to mentor, as they started working they became close friends. Friendship blossomed into love. Their deep connection in love, trust in each other's capabilities, challenges encountered together brought them success in their endeavors.There is no handbook for the incoming First Lady. It's technically not a job or an official government title. But, certainly there was an inclination to engage actively and work towards achieving measurable results. Being a First Lady, it was never a bed of roses as she had to strike a balance between family, friends and work. She served a as a role model and aimed to eradicate problems such as obesity, poverty, irregularities in the education system and supported causes like the importance of nutrition and fitness regime.There is so much truth and  integrity and raw emotions to be pointed out in this book. There is truly something in these pages that makes a person challenge oneself to BECOME more.Definitely worth readingShobha Venkatesha

  This is my first non-fiction read. My first autobiography. But I was far from apprehensive to pick it up. Michelle Obama has been such an unmissable icon in the last decade, I've always looked up to her. I was very excited when the book came out. I was curious about Michelle's story of her life before and after becoming First Lady. And that's precisely what I got from the book. And I was deeply satisfied. The best thing about this book, it is not strictly political non-fiction. It even reads more like a novel and less like a memoir.The things that struck me about Michelle in her descriptions of the many events (big and small) in this book are, her grounded nature, high emotional quotient, consciously and constantly doing the right thing, being a fierce, protective mother and wife, an accomplished career woman, and a First Lady who cared deeply for the people of her country, all the while never losing confidence and enthusiasm.At the end of the day, she effortlessly normalizes her larger-than-life image and tells the reader that she's just like anybody else, keeping up with life and its many demands and managing to succeed. There's a thing or two about life in general that we can learn from Michelle Obama.Do give it a read and be enlightened.

Takes us into the world of privilege and no privilege - how each side shapes people.

I love the fact that they were just two normal people from normal backgrounds who became the US president for two terms. I did however find the second half way too political and boring.

  I am not familiar with American politics, but Michelle's description of what it's like to live and breathe politics inside the world's most powerful nation, has left me with a better understanding.  New Zealand and the US have long enjoyed a close friendship and I am delighted to have learned so much from this well written book.  Thank you Michelle and I wish you, your husband and your family my best wishes as you move into the next chapter of your lives.

Recommended reading for all young women,Canada,5 mars 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  I knew it was going to be great, I just wasn't sure it was going to be this great.  It is a bit of a rags to riches story with a few dollops of humility along the way. It is great to get some of the ""inside scoop"" to the major events that marked Obama's time in office and how they impacted those around him. Her stories of specific incidents are detailed and at times humorous (e.g. being driven by Prince Phillip sitting beside the Queen) but all point to ways in which women at any level can add value through trust and believing in yourself. A great primer for any young woman.

  Class. Genuine. Real. Driven. Caring. Insightful. Humility. Inspirational.Those are the words I would use to describe Michelle Obama and Barack Obama! A great meaningful read of what true leadership and good everyday people is about regardless of position (and considering position they had, even more credit to be as real as they were)It wasn‚Äôt all happy and easy times, and appreciated the honesty and deep dive even into the most difficult and sad moments! Definitely worth future re reads

Great read of political life of Michelle Oboma as a minority‚Äôs black American woman in politics.,Canada,29 mars 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  Really enjoyed the pace of the biography. Very candid and well-written. Michelle graciously speaks of others and presents facts without blaming, shaming, and attacks which is almost uncommon with people in politics. Although Michelle, throughout the book, repeatedly reports she doesn‚Äôt like politics, is adverse to it, and would never run herself in a political office, she indeed writes a very political account. She rallies people and informs people of the black African struggles, especially women, blatantly reports racism in varying form, candidly shares her own level of comfort among her own race and her discomfort, especially with white male dominance. Very down to earth and relatable. A great read.

Well written,Inde,23 juin 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  This book is an absolute gem. Michelle Obama has very carefully listed all points of her journey, right from the time she stayed in south side Chicago to being in the white house. The way she has constructed the book and aligning of chapters in her life and bringing those chapters into play in different situations is truly a hallmark of how good a writer she is. She is articulate, disciplined in the way she approaches different subjects, lot of emotions being put into writing the book & gives the reader a view of Michelle as a person and not just as the First Lady.

  I‚Äôll admit that I was a Michelle fan before reading ‚ÄòBecmining‚Äô but I‚Äôll also admit that I never knew who she really was until this biography. Her intellect and compassion shone as brightly as her drive, striving to make a difference in the world whether it was in community halls or the podium. A daughter, a sister, a professional lawyer, a wife, a mother, a mentor, an advocate, an example. The world would be a better place if we all were a little bit more like Michelle Robinson.

Overrated,Italie,4 juin 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  A well written memoir but I feel this book is slightly overrated, Michelle Obama's story is similar to many others, hers became a best sellers because of her husband. Don't get me wrong she's a formidable woman but hers is one of many other stories of perseverance which often aren't known.

An intimate portrait of an extremely great woman.,Canada,13 avril 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  Michelle Obama comes across as a very approachable and likeable person who can relate to virtually everybody. She describes her early life in great detail, and her life as FLOTUS focussing on her family and her projects. I would not be surprised if she is as devastated by the activities in the current White House now, as she and so many of us were after the November 2016 election.A very readable and enjoyable book.

You can win,Inde,25 octobre 2020,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  An excellent account of how a very large percentage of Americans is offered. Though it might still be better than what most of developing countries offer but starkly different from the other half of America. The emotional turmoil, the subtle discrimination and the complex social structure that a child is subjected to test a child and families to remain motivated, confident and still trust the system.That is what Mitchell Obama bring forth in this lucid description of her upbringing and finally going on to become the first lady. Her trust in herself and in the fairness of the system sees her through all the ups and downs. And at bottom line, it is the strong family ties and support that matters most.

Becoming- An aspiration to be the best of yourself.,Inde,13 ao√ªt 2020,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  When I started reading Becoming, I didn't know exactly how it will turn out. I've always been a fiction person and this was my 1st step to break the monotony.( I found it too expensive at that time on Amazon that I instead read it on my Kindle). What happens next would be too overwhelming for me to comprehend but I'd just say, the journey of Michael, her writing style, the way she has mentioned tiniest details of some of the days in her life that shaped the future or herself, her family and her career is a must read for everyone, especially the women of today who aspire big but question the possibilities more. Tbh there wasn't a single chapter which seemed stretched to me. I have enjoyed it thoroughly and after that no book is able to satisfy me( Still searching). I ended up gifting the paperback version to a dear friend of mine on her birthday as after reading it, it didn't feel expensive.

A great read, which left me wanting to read Barack's books next.

  I was inspired by her honest confession to fulfill her dreams to become a Professional Lawyer. She and her brother grew up in a modest family. Her dreams came to a halt when she met Barak Obama. Like any young couple dating and setting their life long bondage to achieve their goals is a glowing example in the global stage in Politics. She has showcased her role as the First Lady with grace and confidence. Both Barak Obama and Michelle Obama proved to be caring, loving parents to their two daughters.

It was all those little steps -  if she didn't get the marks she wanted, just working a little harder - aiming high and always contributing to helping the community locally and globally, while taking her role of Mom very seriously  that got her where she is. Kudos to Michelle and thanks to Michelle for sharing her wonderful story.

Vor allem die Erz√§hlungen √ºber die Beziehung der beiden vor seiner Kandidatur f√ºr die Pr√§sidentschaftswahl hat mir sehr gut gefallen, weil man einen tieferen Einblick in die Ehe der beiden bekommt.Ich pers√∂nlich war schon immer ein Fan der Obamas und dieses Buch hat mein Bild der beiden noch einmal ins Positive ver√§ndert.Des Weiteren habe ich noch nie w√§hrend ich eine Biografie gelesen habe so viel gelacht und geweint. Der Schreibstil hat mich sehr angesprochen, da ich normalerweise bei dieser Art Buch nicht so emotional investiert bin.

  Not only was Michelle the finest FLOTUS to date, she is an inspirational woman and her story is very much worth reading.  It reminds us that we cannot begin to understand US politics without understanding the country's ongoing racial nightmare.  The legacy of slavery, the seizure of Mexican lands (from modern-day California to Texas) and outdated beliefs in European/White superiority make life immeasurably more challenging for those who are not white, male, Anglo-Saxon and already rich.  And yet, there are people like Michelle who embody the sentiments expressed in Maya Angelou's poem, Still I Rise.

As a coloured woman in a white man's world, working twice as hard, and twice as fast, always conscious of the criticisms, and rising above them.

Inspirational and moving,Canada,17 d√©cembre 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  This is a great bio  on a wonderful role model for women (or for anyone, for that matter). The writing style is very clear, personable and doesn't talk down the reader and I really appreciate the honesty and integrity of Michelle.  I also learned a lot and appreciate the many inspirational take away messages that are so positive and non-divisive. Michelle for president!!

Wonderful book,Australie,22 janvier 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  This is such a good book. Obama is a really fluent writer, but also interesting and a great degree of transparency allowing us to see into her life. She‚Äôs making it clear that she‚Äôs no hero, but in doing so, she proves that she is. A wonderful role model for women and men everywhere. This book is unputdownable ...

Expected more.. but got a little,Inde,13 mai 2020,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  Though I have the highest regard for President Obama (despite living in India with no cultural or religious or conservative connections) for his simplicity and for the man always walking the talk. Except her kitchen garden venture in the White House and her enormous but sometimes selfish love for  her kids are her only achievements besides a devoted wife for the most powerful man on the planet.

An Amazing Portrait of an Amazing Woman,Canada,17 avril 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  This is a book that gives much clarity to what being an ambitious, black woman in America entails.  In deed even what being any woman in America requires! Her openness & honesty are refreshingly unpolitical!  I would recommend this book as an eye opener to every one who has ingested the lies & vitriol of certain bigoted mainstream national news networks.

"

Open and honest life story,Canada,29 septembre 2019,Achat v√©rifi√©,"

  Michelle Obama's writing style is relaxed and unforced, like she's telling a story which she basically is; her story. It reinforces how early learning gives children a head start and expectations of success give children the confidence to push forward regardless of their social background. She is open and honest in expressing her joys and sorrows. Reading 'Becoming' is a pleasure and shows how grounded a woman Michelle Obama is.

  I loved everything about this book. It warmed my heart to hear about her family, her upbringing and her struggle to make a significant contribution in the world. She wrote frankly and positively about her life without hubris or self-aggrandisement. She didn't overdo the political side and gave an endearing account of her obviously successful marriage. In our book club several of us gave it a 10 out of 10 with the lowest score being 9 out of 10. An excellent read!

  The item was exactly as expected. The execution was not.

Really fast shipping, just maybe a little too fast?

  I was really interested in Michelle‚Äôs early life and, thankfully, this is where the book spent most of its time. I‚Äôd have liked more detail about their time in the White House but she does touch on her role, the girls and the family side of the presidency. Sometimes a bit wordy for the sake of being wordy (didn‚Äôt really add to the story) but it wasn‚Äôt excessive. Totally recommend!
